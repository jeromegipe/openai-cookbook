Overall, just 10 of 20 states that reported crime lab backlogs of any size at some point between 2018 and 2021 had reduced them by 2022.<br/><br/>Notably, some states provided data to USAFacts with different thresholds for a backlog.

Article,Hunter Biden’s Questionable Case of ‘Special Treatment’ (230621news.hunter) (251 PV),Wed Jun 21 18:46:49 EDT 2023,Wed Jun 21 18:46:49 EDT 2023,"Republicans called Hunter Biden's plea agreement on tax and gun-related charges a ""sweetheart deal,"" a ""traffic ticket"" punishment a less-connected American would not have been offered.<br/><br/>And the president's son may well have gotten special treatment – but not in a good way, tax lawyers and former prosecutors say.<br/><br/>""The tax charges that were filed are not normally tax charges that we would have recommended at the Justice Department. We just don't prioritize failure to file, with a relatively low dollar amount and no sign or evidence of evasion, or an effort to conceal"" a scheme to avoid paying taxes, says Brian Galle, a former prosecutor of tax crimes at the Department of Justice.<br/><br/>""By traditional Justice Department criteria, we wouldn't have charged this case,"" adds Galle, a professor at Georgetown Law. ""Mr. Biden's kind of getting worse treatment than a typical defendant would get.""<br/><br/>Prominent tax attorney Eric Green notes that ""there are more than 10 million non-filers"" across the country, but the vast majority are not criminally prosecuted, since it would take an enormous commitment of government resources to take them all to court.<br/><br/>Being famous or politically connected can work against a tax violator, Green and others say, since the government likes to showcase someone whose case will end up in the news. The tax system relies heavily on widespread public compliance, and those stories provide a grim reminder to the less-famous that not paying your taxes can land you in jail. Celebrities, including actor <a  href=""https://www.justice.gov/archive/tax/usaopress/2006/txdv06W_Snipes.html""><u>Wesley Snipes</u></a>, singer Lauryn Hill and baseball player Darryl Strawberry, were sentenced to time behind bars for tax crimes.<br/><br/>""They can't prosecute everyone, so they want to make an example out of people,"" says tax lawyer Daniel Ryan, a partner at Boston-based Sullivan &amp; Worcester who once worked as an attorney in the IRS's chief counsel's office. The message is, ""Look what happened to this guy – it could happen to you,"" Ryan says.<br/><br/>And with Biden, the Justice Department has an added pressure to prosecute, says Green, a partner at Green &amp; Sklarz in Connecticut. ""They have a hostile Republican Congress who's calling for his head. They've indicted Trump. It looks very political if they don't do anything. I think that in some ways, he is getting it worse.""<br/><br/>Biden agreed to a plea deal Tuesday for ""willful"" failure to pay taxes for two years and for failure to note on paperwork for a gun purchase that he had abused drugs. The tax charges, which are misdemeanors, are expected to result in a penalty of probation. The gun-related infraction – based on a law a Texas court has deemed unconstitutional – is expected to be dropped if Biden meets certain, yet unspecified, conditions.<br/><br/>The coming plea has infuriated Republicans, who are vowing to continue their own investigation of both Hunter and President Joe Biden. Hunter Biden, a lawyer and former lobbyist, was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings when his father was vice president and has done business in China and elsewhere.<br/><br/>Republicans insist there is a deeper scandal, one involving bribes to the elder Biden through his son's business dealings. But aside from Hunter Biden's obvious asset of being related to the then-vice president, GOP investigators have yet to show any criminal connection to the elder Biden.<br/><br/>Republicans had hoped that the five-year Justice Department investigation would produce something more damning about Hunter Biden, or at least a more serious punishment. They claim the department has a double standard, indicting Trump on charges that could well result in prison time while letting Hunter Biden go free.<br/><br/>David Weiss, the prosecutor who led the investigation of Hunter Biden, was appointed by Trump.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1687387523853,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014a-d05d-daec-a97a-dd7f61230000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1687387523853,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014a-d05d-daec-a97a-dd7f61230000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016c-9adf-d1ec-a97f-9adf17200002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff7000b&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-e021-d459-a1eb-f7efd9590000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Cartoon Gallery : Political Cartoons on President Joe Biden (190816cartoons.joebiden) (1,939 PV)</usn-enhancement>The Trump and Hunter Biden cases are dramatically different: Trump, after all, is accused of not only wrongly possessing classified and other government documents but refusing to give them back even after a subpoena and a search of his home by the FBI. The younger Biden, experts say, could theoretically have faced prison time, but it would have been very unusual for someone in his tax situation.<br/><br/>""I would have argued for probably a year and a half"" for someone who owed $200,000, as the Weiss statement said the younger Biden failed to pay, says Boston lawyer Evan Gotlob, a former assistant U.S. attorney who handled public corruption and white-collar crime investigations.<br/><br/>But in cases where Justice might seek 12-18 months behind bars, ""it kind of makes sense to plead it out"" anyway, since ""it's not worth the resources to go to trial,"" adds Gotlob, now a partner with Saul Ewing.<br/><br/>But unlike other celebrities who indeed went to jail, the younger Biden was not charged with tax evasion but rather a misdemeanor, experts note. Tax evasion, generally speaking, is committed when someone schemes and defrauds to avoid paying taxes, often involving others and spanning several tax years, explains Keith Rosen, former chief of the criminal division for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware.<br/><br/>If someone merely fails to pay taxes – even when he or she knew it was required by law – the infraction is a misdemeanor. says Rosen, now at the global law firm of Norton Rose Fulbright.<br/><br/>""If you look at the statistics, you would find that those [misdemeanor charges] are frequently offenses that don't result in prison. The Justice Department is not in the business – and the IRS is not in the business – of regularly charging people with misdemeanor tax offenses,"" Rosen adds.<br/><br/>As for the gun charge, people typically aren't prosecuted for it unless it's part of some other illegal conduct or if the defendant has a criminal history, Rosen says.<br/><br/>""I'm not surprised there was a settlement. Settlements in regard to tax matters are relatively common,"" says Eric Chaffee, a law professor at Case Western University School of Law.<br/><br/>""With the election coming up relatively soon, it only benefits the Biden camp if the Hunter Biden matter is put behind them.

While he enjoys the advantages of being a former president – including the fundraising donor lists and the loyal support of a core group of voters who believe he was cheated out of the 2020 win – Trump has a pack of GOP primary foes waiting for him to fall.<br/><br/>The former president is well ahead of his competitors in polls, and the devotion of his base means he could be the GOP field’s strongest candidate against Biden. But his standing could plummet if and when his legal situation worsens.<br/><br/>Trump's criminal trial in New York is scheduled for March 25 – a critical point in the primary season – and a Florida judge set Aug. 14 as the trial date for the government documents case against him (though legal experts believe the trial will be delayed).<br/><br/>Should Trump fall, one of his opponents could try to take the conservative mantle. But only two of Trump's GOP primary challengers – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina – have approval ratings above 50% among Republican voters, Marist found.<br/><br/>DeSantis, who is running a distant second to Trump in primary polls, has an approval rating of 67% among Republicans, Marist found, while Scott has a favorability rating of 50%.

The rhetoric will all but certainly continue to heat up as Biden positions himself for reelection against a challenger from the Republican Party, which has consistently criticized his handling of Chinese economic and military aggression.<br/><br/>China has likewise attempted to portray the high-profile summit with the visiting diplomat as an example of U.S. acquiescence – a narrative Biden’s domestic political rivals, too, are eager to embrace.<br/><br/>Republicans have widely condemned the optics of Blinken’s trip, including imagery China has widely proliferated showing the chief U.S. diplomat sitting at a table in a grand meeting room listening to Xi, seated at the head and conspicuously higher up. Chinese state media has also drawn subtle attention to the fact the meeting took place on Father’s Day, suggesting that Beijing is moving toward a paternal relationship with America.<br/><br/>Blinken himself balked at questions on Tuesday when asked if the U.S. president sees his Chinese counterpart as an equal.<br/><br/>“I’m not quite sure how to take that question,” Blinken said from London, where he was traveling for a meeting with Ukraine’s international benefactors about reconstruction for the war-torn country. “President Xi is the leader of China and, in and of itself, that makes him someone of tremendous significance on the world stage.”<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1687361655227,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000154-0691-d75e-a95c-2fdd7a650000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1687361655227,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000154-0691-d75e-a95c-2fdd7a650000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-2e55-d18e-a5cf-effd243d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-de97-d9aa-abdc-deff76330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : China’s Growing Influence as an International Mediator (https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2023-03-16/chinas-growing-influence-as-an-international-mediator)</usn-enhancement>Aside from the balloon flap earlier this year, the summit also came amid reports China is investing heavily in new military and intelligence presences in Cuba – details first reported by The Wall Street Journal that the White House has subsequently downplayed as a potential threat it has already begun to address.<br/><br/>“China is trying to improve their global reach and influence and, again, their global intelligence collection capabilities,” John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters on a teleconference this week. “It's not like we aren't aware of it, it's not like we haven't been monitoring it and, quite frankly, it's not like we haven't taken steps and will continue to take steps to thwart it.”<br/><br/>Rep. Mike McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, blasted the summit as wasteful and said the Biden administration’s latest overtures to the Chinese Communist Party are deeply concerning and effectively toothless.<br/><br/>“Blinken brushing off the recent CCP spy balloon that traversed the U.S. was ridiculous and totally dismissive of the concerns of the American people,” the Texas Republican said in a statement in which also lamented what he considered Blinken’s inability to address other issues such as climate change, fentanyl imports to Mexico or returning Americans detained in China. “And just as troubling – China’s recent agreement with Cuba to house a CCP military training facility was not addressed during these meetings.","China, Biden, Joe, Blinken, Antony, world news",,Wed Jun 21 11:43:36 EDT 2023,Paul D.

Here are some tips for finding the best Amazon Prime Day deals:<br/><br/><h3><b>Beware of fake reviews </b></h3><br/>Reviews with glaring grammatical errors or products that have a high percentage of five-star reviews and almost as many one-star reviews can be red flags. But there are ways to weed out fake reviews. Browser extensions like Fakespot will grade each item from A to F based on whether the reviews seem legitimate. Keep in mind the grade refers to the quality of the reviews – it's not a review of the product.<br/><br/><h3><b>Compare prices</b> </h3><br/>Some large retailers hold their own rival sales during Prime Day. <a  href=""https://deals.usnews.com/coupons/target"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://deals.usnews.com/coupons/target&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Target</a> is running its Deal Days event July 11-13. <a  href=""https://deals.usnews.com/coupons/best-buy"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""00000181-8ba1-d225-a5e5-cbf920b00001"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-8ba1-d225-a5e5-cbf920b00001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;e67a94b2-4073-4ffe-a77a-d04fcee28e18&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Best Buy</a> is also known for competing with Prime Day by holding its own Black Friday in July savings event.<br/><br/><h3>Do your research</h3><br/>Have a list of items you're interested in and research them before the shopping event starts. The short time frame of the event will call for quick decisions and you want to be sure of your purchases.<br/><br/><h3>Review the return policy</h3><br/>Most items purchased through Amazon have a 30-day return period after delivery. However, some items aren't returnable, such as products missing UPCs as well as gift cards, select jewelry items, and some health and personal care items.<br/><br/>Resellers may also have a different return policy. Check the full return policy for all the details. <br/>  <br/><h2><b>More Deals To Save</b></h2><ul><li><a  href=""https://deals.usnews.com/deals/best-fourth-of-july-deals"" target=""_blank""

You'll have 48 hours to shop some of the best deals available on the site until the holiday season. The event started in July 2015 and was only 24 hours long, but it's been two days long since 2019. Fortunately, if you happen to miss the designated sale days, there will still be deals on Amazon throughout the week.<br/><br/>Last year, Amazon introduced a second two-day sale event called Prime Early Access Sale, which took place Oct. 11-12. The event was similar to Prime Day and was meant to help shoppers get a head start on their holiday shopping. The Prime Early Access Sale may return this year, but we won't know for sure until Amazon announces it later in the year.<br/><br/><h2>What Is Amazon Prime Day?&nbsp;</h2>Amazon Prime Day is an annual two-day sale that takes place on amazon.com. It started in 2015 as a single-day sale to celebrate the online retailer’s 20th birthday and boost revenue during the summer slump in sales. Since then, Prime Day has grown to a nearly week-long event with millions of discounts on everything from Fire TV sticks to coffee makers.<br/><br/>Last year was the biggest Prime Day yet with more than 300 million items purchased and more than $1.7 billion saved by shoppers – the most savings of any prior year, according to Amazon. The most popular items fell into these categories: Amazon devices, consumer electronics, and home products.<br/><br/>The discounts are only available to Amazon Prime members, so you’ll need to sign up for a Prime membership to access the exclusive deals.<br/><br/>If you don’t have a Prime membership, you can still score major discounts on Prime Day at other retailers.

Despite the reference to 2007, our baseline is that the economic slowdown does not produce another ‘2008,’ yet investors should anticipate some volatility as the economic outlook remains cloudy.”<br/><br/>In particular, while there are signs the economy has slowed, the labor market still remains extremely tight by historical standards and the <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2023-06-20/feds-powell-to-testify-to-congress-as-new-housing-construction-surges"">housing market seems to be showing new signs of life.</a><br/><br/>Some economists are now backing off their predictions of an imminent recession, the common result of a Fed tightening cycle and diminished economic growth. But there remain headwinds, notably less availability of credit and inflation that is eating into consumer pocketbooks.<br/><br/>“In this unique business cycle defined by unusual labor market characteristics, there is scope for hope that the US economy could escape a recession,” EY Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco wrote Wednesday morning.<br/><br/>“Indeed, unlike in prior downturns, business executives have proven reticent to dispose of the pool of talent they struggled to hire, train, and retain post-pandemic,” he added. “This labor hoarding phenomenon has so far translated into a limited drag on household income and, as a result, a gradual consumer spending slowdown rather than a retrenchment.”","inflation, Federal Reserve, Powell, Jerome, economy",picks,Wed Jun 21 10:51:27 EDT 2023,Tim Smart

Many national banks offer an APY of only 0.01% on their savings accounts. That's the case for <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/banking/reviews/jpmorgan-chase-co"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>JPMorgan Chase Bank</u></a>, <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/banking/reviews/bank-of-america-corp"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Bank of America</u></a> and <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/banking/reviews/wells-fargo-co"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><u>Wells Fargo Bank</u></a> – three of the largest U.S. banks.<br/><br/>Over one year, $1,000 stored in a savings account with a 0.01% APY will earn 10 cents of interest.

The rates are variable, and a bank can change its savings account interest rate at any time. Rates don't bounce around, though. Instead, they generally move in concert with the federal funds rate, a target interest rate the Federal Reserve sets.<br/><br/>Lowering interest rates makes it cheaper for governments, businesses and individuals to borrow money, which then should stimulate the economy. Raising interest rates are supposed to tamp down inflation. During the Great Recession, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate to a range of 0%-0.25%. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the Fed once again lowered interest rates to the same 0%-0.25% target. While this is good for borrowers, it isn’t great for savers.

Ask these questions as you compare account options:<br/><br/><ul><li><b>APY.</b> What annual percentage yield will your money earn? The higher the percentage, the better.</li><li><b>Account minimum.</b> Is there a required minimum balance you need to maintain in your high-interest savings account to earn interest or avoid fees? Is the APY tiered? In other words, does the account only hit the high interest rate with a high deposit balance?</li><li><b>Fees.</b> Does the bank charge monthly maintenance fees? If it does charge fees, how onerous is it to avoid them?</li><li><b>Other factors.</b> How many withdrawals are permitted per month? How easy is the sign-up process? What can you do from the bank’s app?</li></ul><br/>The best high-yield savings accounts, typically offered by online banks, have high APYs, low account minimums, no fees and robust mobile banking platforms.

This is a straightforward process. The easiest way to open an account is online, from the bank or credit union's website. Here's how to do it:<br/><ol><li><b>Meet the minimum requirements.</b> To open a new savings account, you'll need to be 18 or older, have a home address in the United States, and have a valid Social Security number or tax identification number.</li><li><b>Supply personal information.</b> Click ""open account,"" and start by entering your personal information, including your name and birthdate. Because you aren't applying for credit, the bank won't check your credit score.</li><li><b>Accept terms and conditions.</b> Click through to agree to the bank's terms and conditions for opening an account.</li><li><b>Fund the new account.</b> Once you connect an existing account to your new account, you can transfer money into your new savings account. To keep growing your savings account, consider setting up automatic transfers.</li></ol><h2></h2><h2>Can You Lose Money in a High-Yield Savings Account?</h2><br/>Another reason that high-yield savings accounts are safe is that your balance can't go down.

In the past 10 years, the S&amp;P 500 has had an average annual return of 11.25% (and that's including the 22% drop in the index in 2022). An APY of 2.5% in a high-yield savings account doesn’t compare that favorably.</li><li><b>There are withdrawal restrictions.</b> The Federal Reserve Board used to restrict savings account withdrawals or transfers to six a month, with certain exceptions. In April 2020, the Fed announced an interim rule to waive the limit to help people access needed funds during the pandemic. Even though the limit continues to be waived at the federal level, banks and credit unions have applied it unevenly in practice. Some banks have maintained the six-withdrawal limit, while others have raised it to eight or nine a month. Others have eliminated it completely. Check what the limit is for your bank or credit union.</li></ul><h2><label  data-toc-text=""Alternatives to High-Interest Savings Accounts"" data-id=""what-are-some-alternatives-to-high-interest-savings-accounts"">What Are Some Alternatives to High-Interest Savings Accounts?</label></h2>A high-yield savings account is a great way to store your money safely, but it isn’t the only way.

The math decline marks the single largest decline observed in the last half century on the exam. Compared to when the test was administered a decade ago, the average scores declined 7 points in reading and 14 points in mathematics.<br/><br/>“The green shoots of academic recovery that we had hoped to see have not materialized, as we continue to see worrisome signs about student achievement and well-being more than two years after most students returned for in-person learning,” said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, the Education Department’s research arm, which administered the test.<br/><br/>“There are signs of risk for a generation of learners in the data,” Carr said on a press call with reporters on Tuesday. “We are observing steep drops in achievement, troubling shifts in reading habits and other factors that affect achievement, and rising mental health challenges alongside alarming changes in school climate.”<br/><br/>The new scores mirror declines observed in other national tests administered by NCES, including the math and reading exams given to fourth- and eighth-grade students, also known as the “Nation’s Report Card,” especially the major drops in math. Another common theme that held true in the newest assessment data: Scores declined for all student subgroups, including gender, race and geographic location.

What we may be seeing here though is that the learning disruption further undermined the development of basic skills that students need at this age, particularly the lower performing students.”<br/><br/>The test was administered this school year, from October through December, and was given to 13-year-olds, most of whom were in eighth grade. At the onset of the pandemic, most of the students were 10. The release of the achievement data marks the final in a series of federal efforts to track the academic impact of COVID-19.<br/><br/>In addition to testing students on basic math and reading concepts, the assessment also surveyed students on their learning experiences in and out of the classroom. Roughly one-third of 13-year-olds said they “never or hardly ever” read for fun, for example, compared to 22% who said the same a decade ago. And just 24% reported taking algebra compared to 34% who reported taking it a decade ago.<br/><br/>“The big message here,” Carr said, “is that there is a long road ahead of us.”<br/><br/>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona echoed that sentiment in a statement, saying that the results are evidence of what the Biden administration has known since Day one – “that the pandemic would have a devastating impact on students’ learning across the country and that it would take years of effort and investment to reverse the damage.”<br/><br/>Though encouraged by a trickle of states beginning to report state-specific math and reading achievement that matches pre-pandemic levels, Cardona said that “this latest data reminds us how far we still need to go.”","K-12 education, education, standardized tests, testing",,Wed Jun 21 00:01:00 EDT 2023,Lauren Camera

Understanding which is more relevant to you depends on the medical condition for which you’re seeking hospital quality information.<br/><br/>The Best Hospitals specialty rankings are meant for patients with life-threatening or rare conditions who need a hospital that excels in treating complex, high-risk cases. These rankings are helpful if you’re looking for information about a rare condition or difficult diagnosis that isn’t treated at many facilities.<br/><br/>Hospitals are ranked from 1 to 50 in each specialty, with hospitals not in the top 50 but still in the top 10% of all rated hospitals receiving a designation of “high performing.”<br/><br/>The Best Hospitals procedure and condition ratings focus on specific and more commonly required individual procedures and conditions, such as <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/total-hip-replacement"">hip replacement</a> and <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/conditions/heart-disease/congestive-heart-failure"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/conditions/heart-disease/congestive-heart-failure&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">heart failure</a>, rather than on broader specialties like orthopedics and cardiology. The goal is to evaluate how well hospitals perform in each procedure or condition – not just with the most challenging cases, as with the specialty rankings, but with the full range of patients.<br/><br/>Because the procedures and conditions evaluated are performed at many more hospitals than the specialties, the evaluations produce ratings rather than numerical rankings. Hospitals that treat enough patients to be evaluated are rated one of three ways for each procedure or condition: high performing, average or below average.<br/><br/>Based on your health situation, it might make more sense to go to an average hospital closer to you or within your insurance network than a high-performing hospital that is far and out-of-network.<br/><br/><div  id=""best-hospitals"">As always, these ratings should be taken as a starting point.

In 12 of the specialty areas, rankings are derived from data sources, such as Medicare:<br/><ul><li>Cancer.</li><li>Cardiology and heart surgery.</li><li>Diabetes and endocrinology.</li><li>Ear, nose and throat.</li><li>Gastroenterology and GI surgery.</li><li>Geriatrics.</li><li>Obstetrics and gynecology.</li><li>Neurology and neurosurgery.</li><li>Orthopedics.</li><li>Pulmonology and lung surgery.</li><li>Rehabilitation.</li><li>Urology.</li></ul><br/>In the remaining three specialties – ophthalmology, psychiatry and rheumatology – ranking is determined entirely by expert opinion, based on responses from three years of surveys of physician specialists who were asked to name the hospitals to which they would be inclined to refer their sickest patients.<br/><br/>The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">rankings</a> name the top 50 hospitals for complex care in each of the 12 data-driven specialties and roughly a dozen in the three expert-opinion-based specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why does U.S. News rank hospitals?</b></h3><br/>U.S. News estimates that nearly two million hospital inpatients a year face the prospect of surgery or special care that poses either unusual technical challenges or significantly heightened risk of death or harm because of age, physical condition or existing conditions. The rankings are a tool that can help these patients find sources of skilled inpatient care.<br/><br/><h3><b>Who might be a patient like this?</b></h3><br/>Someone in their 80s with pancreatic cancer would be one of many such examples. Most hospitals would reject this patient – as they should if their surgeons lack the expertise to remove the cancer without harming the rest of the fragile pancreas.<br/><br/>But multiple investigations by U.S. News have found that some hospitals without the requisite skills would go ahead, possibly at considerable risk.

As noted, rankings in 12 of the 15 rely largely on objective data. Each specialty showcases the 50 top-scoring hospitals, based primarily on survival rates for particularly challenging patients, patient experience and other measures of performance that can be assessed using hard data. All evaluated hospitals and their results, including overall scores, are displayed online, but rankings are only displayed for the top 50.<br/><br/>In these 12 specialties, results from the three most recent years of an annual expert-opinion survey of specialized physicians are also factored in. Surveyed physicians are asked to name up to five hospitals they consider the best for complex cases in their specialty.<br/><br/>Except in rehabilitation; ear, nose and throat; and obstetrics and gynecology, hospitals not nationally ranked but that scored high enough in a specialty to put them in the top 10% of the analyzed centers are recognized as high performing. Hospitals nationally ranked in at least one data-determined specialty, or that earned at least six ratings of high performing and few or no low performing ratings across the 20 <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/faq-how-and-why-we-rank-and-rate-hospitals#common-care"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Hospitals procedures and conditions,</a> are further designated as <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area"">Best Regional Hospitals</a> within their state, metro area or region.<br/><br/>In the three Best Hospitals expert-opinion-based specialties, national ranking is based on the latest three annual physician surveys referenced above. Those receiving nominations from a weighted average of at least 5% of the respondents are nationally ranked Best Hospitals. Those nominated by at least 3% but below 5% of physicians are high performing. Each physician's response is assigned a weight that ensures the weighted averages represent the overall opinion of all specialists nationally, not simply those who responded.<br/><br/>The 20 hospitals with the most and highest rankings and the greatest number of high-performing procedure and condition ratings are recognized in the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"">Honor Roll</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>Are the highest-ranking hospitals always the best choices?</b></h3><br/>Not necessarily. Hospitals are evaluated across a wide range of conditions and procedures. Within that range, hospitals can and do perform differently. In <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/pulmonology"">pulmonology and lung surgery</a>, for example, a hospital might rank below another one but do better at treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br/><br/><h3><b>So the rankings should just be a starting point?</b></h3><br/>That's right. Patients still have to do their research and talk with their doctors. We also understand that families have to consider such factors as the stress and expense of travel and lodging in another city and their <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-insurance"">insurer's</a> willingness to pay for care if a hospital is out of network.<br/><br/><h3><b>How many hospitals were analyzed for the rankings?</b></h3><br/>For consideration in the 12 data-driven rankings, the rankings started with about 4,500 hospitals, which represent virtually all U.S. community inpatient facilities.<br/><br/><h3><b>Are only teaching hospitals eligible for the rankings?</b></h3><br/>No. That misconception persists, even in medical journals that make the assertion. In fact, teaching status or medical-school affiliation are only two of the four ways a hospital can be a rankings candidate.<br/><br/>Many hospitals become part of the eligible pool through two other pathways. A hospital qualified for consideration in the 12 data-driven specialties if it satisfied <i>any</i> of four criteria:<br/><ul><li>It was a teaching hospital.</li><li>It was affiliated with a medical school.</li><li>It had at least 200 beds set up and staffed.</li><li>It had at least 100 beds and offered at least four out of eight advanced technologies associated with high-quality care, such as a PET/CT scanner and certain precision radiation therapies.</li></ul>More than 2,000 hospitals met one of the four standards. Eligibility standards for the rehabilitation rankings were slightly different.<br/><br/><br/>In the three specialties in which ranking was determined only through the last three physician surveys, any hospital with enough nominations was ranked.<br/><br/><h3><b>Does U.S. News evaluate and rank Veterans Affairs and military hospitals?</b></h3><br/>No. Claims data for VA and military hospitals are unavailable in Medicare claims data and are largely unavailable. If these data become publicly available, we will consider evaluating them.<br/><br/><h3><b>What happens after determining initial eligibility?</b></h3><br/>Hospitals had to show that they treated a given number of patients with explicitly-defined conditions or procedures. The threshold number for each specialty was based on traditional fee-for-service <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/medicare"">Medicare</a> inpatients discharged during the three years from 2018 to 2020 (2020 is the most recent year of available data).<br/><br/>Because the rankings focus on challenging care, only patients who had particular procedures or conditions at a defined level of severity and complexity were included.<br/><br/>A hospital that fell short was still evaluated if it was nominated by at least 1% of the physicians in a specialty who responded to 2020, 2021 and 2022 physician surveys.<br/><br/>A total of 2,203 hospitals met these standards and qualified for further consideration in at least one specialty.<br/><br/>For a schematic overview of the eligibility process for the rankings, complete with this year’s hospital population data, you can refer to page 11 of the 2022-2023 U.S. News Best Hospitals Specialty Rankings methods <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BH_Methodology_2022-23"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BH_Methodology_2022-23&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">report</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>How many hospitals were ranked?</b></h3><br/>Across all 15 specialties, only 164 U.S. hospitals performed well enough to be nationally ranked in one or more specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>What determined whether a hospital would be ranked?</b></h3><br/>We evaluated each hospital's performance using a variety of measures. Some data came from the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' Standard Analytical File database. Other information came from the American Hospital Association and professional organizations.<br/><br/>We put the heaviest reliance on outcomes because of the self-evident connection between a patient's outcomes, including survival and the quality of their care. Other data, such as the number of patients and the ratio of nurses and patients, are less obviously related to quality, but ample research supports the connection. The physician survey also played a role, although it accounted for only slightly more than one-fourth of each hospital's score (see below).<br/><br/>In the three expert-opinion-based specialties, most care is delivered on an outpatient basis. The number of outpatients who die in these specialties is so low that risk-adjusted mortality rates, heavily weighted in 11 of the 12 other specialties, are not significantly tied to the quality of care. Hospitals in these specialties are therefore ranked solely on expert opinion.<br/><br/><h3><b>How were the different factors combined?</b></h3><br/>Each hospital analyzed in 11 of the 12 data-driven rankings received an overall score from 0 to 100 based on four elements:<br/><ul><li>Outcomes (including survival rate and the rate at which patients were able to return home rather than needing additional institutional care).</li><li>Patient experience.</li><li>Care-related factors such as the intensity of nurse staffing and the breadth of patient services.</li><li>Expert opinion obtained through the physician survey. (Rehabilitation used a unique methodology, as described in the methodology report.)</li></ul>The hospitals with the 50 highest scores in each specialty were ranked. Scores and data for all eligible hospitals in each specialty are also posted. The four elements and their weightings are, in brief:<br/><br/><b>Patient Outcomes (37.5%)</b><br/><br/>A hospital's success at keeping patients alive accounted for 30% of its score. U.S. News compared the number of Medicare inpatients with certain conditions who died within 30 days of admission in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with the number who would be expected to die given the severity of illness.<br/><br/>Hospitals were scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest statistical likelihood that the survival rate was better than expected and 1 indicating that survival rates were worse than expected. U.S. News' calculation of each hospital's expected deaths factored in:<br/><ul><li>The age and sex of each patient.</li><li>What kind of care they needed.</li><li>What other illnesses (known as comorbidities) were present.</li><li>Whether they received Medicaid benefits (a measure of socioeconomic status).</li><li>Other risk factors known to influence patients' outcomes.</li></ul><b>Patient Experience (5%)</b><br/><br/>This score reflects the percentage of patients who responded positively to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS, a survey about the overall quality of their hospital stay. Most hospitals are required to assess patients' satisfaction using the HCAHPS survey.<br/><br/><b>Other Care-Related Indicators (30%)</b><br/><br/>These include nurse staffing, patient volume, certain clinically proven technologies and professional and specialty-specific recognition. The 2020 American Hospital Association Annual Survey was the primary source.<br/><br/><b>Expert Opinion (27.5%)</b><br/><br/>Each year, board-certified physicians in the relevant specialties are invited to list up to five hospitals, ignoring location and cost, that they consider to be the best in their area of expertise for complex or challenging cases.<br/><br/>The figures displayed in the rankings represent the average percentage of responding specialists in 2020, 2021 and 2022 who rated the hospitals. More than 32,000 physicians responded in 2022.<br/><br/>In three specialties – cardiology and heart surgery; obstetrics and gynecology; and neurology and neurosurgery – expert opinion received a reduced weight to accommodate public transparency metrics. Expert opinion receives a weight of 24.5% in cardiology and heart surgery and obstetrics and gynecology, and 25.5% in neurology and neurosurgery, with 3% and 2% weight, respectively, determined by the extent to which a hospital is publicly transparent about specific care-related performance metrics. Expert opinion is weighted 50.0% in rehabilitation and 27.5% in most other data-driven specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>Does reputation determine which hospitals are ranked?</b></h3><br/>No. Many ranked hospitals have very low, even zero, reputational scores but are strong clinical performers.<br/><br/><h3><b>How are hospitals ranked in the three specialties without objective data?</b></h3><br/>In the three expert-opinion-determined specialties, ranked hospitals had to be cited by an average of at least 5% of the physicians who responded to the latest three years of U.S. News surveys of specialists. That resulted in lists of 12 hospitals in ophthalmology, 11 in psychiatry and 11 in rheumatology.<br/><br/><h3><b>What methodology changes were made in the 2022-2023 rankings?</b></h3><br/>Several targeted methodological revisions were implemented this year based on input from patients, clinicians, researchers and hospital leaders. These and other modifications to the methodology are described in <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">this blog post</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>How does U.S. News decide what changes to make to its methodology?</b></h3><br/>Each year RTI International and U.S. News revisit the methodology based on the medical literature and input from hospitals and health care experts. U.S. News approves all methodology changes.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""honor-roll-hospitals"">2022-2023 Best Hospitals Honor Roll, Published July 2022</label></h2><br/><h3><b>What is the Honor Roll?</b></h3>The Best Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes 20 hospitals with unusual competence taking into account the full range of adult inpatient care – both performance in the Best Hospitals specialty rankings and the Best Hospitals procedures and conditions.<br/><br/><h3><b>How were points awarded?</b></h3>Hospitals were awarded points by being nationally ranked in the 12 Best Hospitals specialty rankings, driven primarily by hard data or in the three expert-opinion-based specialty rankings, or by being rated as high performing in 20 procedures and conditions.<br/><br/>All 50 hospitals received points in each of the 11 data-driven specialties (excluding rehabilitation). The No. 1-ranked hospital received 25 Honor Roll points, No. 2 received 24 points and so on. All hospitals ranked 21 through 50 received five points. The maximum number of points across these 11 specialties is 275, but no hospital has ever been No. 1 in all 12 specialties.<br/><br/>In rehabilitation and the three Best Hospitals specialty rankings based entirely on expert opinion (ranked hospitals were recommended by at least 5% of respondents to annual U.S. News physician surveys), the number of ranked hospitals varies year by year and specialty by specialty. The No. 1-ranked hospital received 10 Honor Roll points, No. 2 received nine points and so on; all hospitals ranked from 10 to the final ranked hospital received one point. If a hospital had ranked at the top in all four specialties (none was), it would have received 40 points.<br/><br/>In 16 of the 20 Best Hospitals procedures and conditions ratings, hospitals received 12 Honor Roll points for each ""high performing"" rating. “High-performing” status in AVR and TAVR resulted in six points each because these procedures are alternative treatment approaches to the same underlying condition; similarly, high performing status in ovarian cancer surgery and uterine cancer surgery resulted in six points each because tumors in these organs are treated with similar procedures.<br/><br/>Hospitals that achieved a rating of high performing in all 20 procedures and conditions, as four did, received 216 points. In some circumstances, where a health system with multiple hospitals had consolidated a certain service at a regional center of excellence, we reassigned Honor Roll points for that service from the system's center of excellence to the system's so-called flagship hospital.<br/><br/>The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Best Hospitals for Maternity</a> ratings, published on a different annual cycle, were not included in the Honor Roll calculation.<br/><br/>The 20 hospitals that earned the most points out of the 531 possible comprise the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Honor Roll</a>.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""common-care"">2022-2023 Best Hospitals Procedures and Conditions Ratings, Published July 2022</label></h2><br/>In a typical year, U.S. hospitals admit more than 30 million patients. More than 1 million will have a knee or hip replaced, and about 400,000 will undergo heart bypass surgery. Heart failure will account for about 900,000, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease another 700,000 and surgery to remove all or part of the colon will account for some 250,000.<br/><br/>Any hospital should be able to successfully treat such relatively common ailments, and many do – but some treat them better than others. The Best Hospitals procedures and conditions ratings show consumers how well their local hospitals stand up to scrutiny in those six procedures and conditions and the 14 others U.S. News rates.

For each group – called cohorts – we assessed the hospital's risk-adjusted outcomes, such as 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission and length of stay. These measure how well the hospital performed the procedure at the time of care and also was able to prevent an unplanned re-visit to the hospital due to the same condition. A shorter length of stay is indicative of a lower complication rate.<br/><br/>We also factored in variables linked to higher quality of care, including volume, nurse staffing and whether the hospital employed a specially-trained physician known as an intensive care unit specialist. In addition, patient satisfaction scores were factored into the ratings for most procedures.<br/><br/>A hospital's stance on data transparency was also a factor. In our heart bypass surgery and aortic valve surgery ratings, we weighed whether the hospital had voluntarily released ratings it received from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. We factored in STS data for hospitals that had done so as of early 2022.<br/><br/><h3><b>What data sources were used?</b></h3><br/>We analyzed objective data from multiple sources, including a federal data set known as the Standard Analytical File, which contains details of every hospital admission paid for by traditional Medicare. We used SAF data on inpatients aged 65 and older treated from 2016-2020 to assess each hospital's risk-adjusted mortality rates, readmissions and other outcomes. We also used a limited amount of data from late 2015.<br/><br/>How well older patients are treated is generally considered a good test of a hospital's capabilities. Such patients have a greater chance of being admitted with one or more conditions that put them in a higher-risk category, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. We also incorporated some data from the outpatient SAF files into analysis of knee replacement procedure and stroke condition.<br/><br/>In addition, our analysis incorporated publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees Medicare. These included information on each hospital's efforts to prevent dangerous blood clots and the results from federally mandated patient-satisfaction surveys. Claims data from the Medicare database are the most comprehensive source data available. We are open to exploring alternatives for future editions of the ratings. Risk-adjusted data from clinical registries are one promising area.<br/><br/>Hospital reputation was not a factor in the ratings.<br/><br/>Our methodology also drew on several measures from the 2020 American Hospital Association's annual survey and from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, a professional organization for heart and chest surgeons. None of these organizations have endorsed or been asked to endorse the U.S. News ratings.<br/><br/><h3><b>What do the ratings mean?</b></h3><br/>An overall rating of high performing indicates a hospital was significantly better than the national average in a given procedure or condition. Hospitals rated below average scored substantially below the national average. Hospitals rated average do not all have equal performance, but they were not distinctly different from the average in our methodology. In each procedure and condition, 10% to 20% of the evaluated hospitals in a condition or procedure typically fell into the high-performing tier, and another 10% to 20% were rated below average.<br/><br/>Relatively few hospitals performed consistently across all measures for a given condition or procedure. Strengths and weaknesses in particular measures often varied considerably between hospitals with similar overall ratings. Such differences give patients flexibility by allowing them to decide, in consultation with their doctor, which qualities are most important to them. One hospital might have a lower readmission rate but have worse patient experience scores. Another might have a better balance of nurses to patients but a relatively low number of patients.<br/><br/><h3><b>Should I worry about going to a hospital rated average or below average or that is unrated?</b></h3><br/>About 50% to 70% of the hospitals in each procedure or condition were rated as average. Some of these hospitals were rated below average partly because of low patient volume, not necessarily because of a high number of deaths or other adverse events. No firm conclusion can be reached about an unrated hospital; these hospitals did not treat enough patients to be evaluated thoroughly. The ratings are just a starting point for patient decision-making, which certainly should include consulting a doctor.<br/><br/>Pending such consultation, patients who have access to a high performing or average hospital might choose that hospital over one that is below average or unrated in the type of care they need.<br/><br/><h3><b>How did U.S. News build in risk adjustment?</b></h3><br/>We took several risk factors into account:<br/><ul><li><b>Age at admission.</b></li><li><b>Sex.</b></li><li><b>Transfer status.</b> A patient transfer from the initial receiving hospital may indicate a complex procedure or condition. Patients were classified as inbound transfers if they were treated at another acute-care hospital on the day of admission, if claims data indicated they were transferred or if a previous claim indicated an outbound transfer.</li><li><b>Year of hospital admission.</b> Quality of care tends to improve over time. This means the risk of adverse outcomes is less each year. For that reason, and given that the ratings use five years of data, year of admission is included as a risk factor.</li><li><b>Comorbidities. </b>A wide range of comorbidities such as diabetes is associated with higher death rates. This means a patient has multiple diagnoses, with the primary diagnosis being treated, which typically means more challenging care. We used an inventory known as the Elixhauser comorbidities in risk adjustment.</li><li><b>Medicare eligibility status.</b> If a patient is eligible for Medicare because of age, disability or end-stage renal failure, this is a proxy for comorbidities.</li><li><b>Socioeconomic status. </b>Patients with lower incomes and education are typically sicker when they arrive at the hospital and may face more challenges in obtaining or managing their care after discharge. This can affect their risk of death, readmission and complications. When hospitals differ by the socioeconomic status of their patients, this can create bias in comparing outcomes. We used “dual eligibility” – patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid – as a socioeconomic factor.</li></ul><h3><b>Why did U.S. News adjust for socioeconomic status?</b></h3><br/>In 2014, the National Quality Forum, an influential standard-setting body, recommended considering socioeconomic status in certain evaluations of hospital performance. Since our objective is to enable a patient consulting our ratings to make apples-to-apples comparisons among hospitals, it follows that we should adjust for patient attributes such as age, sex and socioeconomic status.<br/><br/><h3><b>Did U.S. News consider patient satisfaction?</b></h3><br/>The methodology uses one measure, how discharged patients rated a hospital overall, from the federal government's quarterly survey called Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS.<br/><br/><h3><b>What changes were made from last year?</b></h3><br/>We made several methodology changes, as described in <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">this blog post</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>How do the U.S. News ratings compare with other public reporting on hospital quality?</b></h3><br/>In judging the validity and usefulness of any public reporting effort to evaluate health facilities, patients should ask:<br/><ul><li>What is its intention?</li><li>What information does it claim to deliver?</li><li>Does it meet the stated intent?</li></ul><br/>Our national Best Hospitals and Best Children's Hospitals rankings, for example, are meant to be used as guidance when life is in the balance or an uncommon condition or procedure is involved. Most patients, thankfully, will not need to consult them.<br/><br/>Best Hospitals for procedures and conditions, on the other hand, rates the overall quality of inpatient care in the kinds of procedures and conditions that many hospitals commonly encounter. Clinical outcomes (such as mortality, readmissions and length of stay) are stressed, but other measures included are patient volume, patient satisfaction and hospital staffing data. Patients can choose to factor some or all of these individual quality indicators into their decisions about where to get care.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""regional-hospitals"">2022-2023 Best Regional Hospitals, <b>Published July 2022</b></label></h2><br/>U.S. News first published <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Regional Hospitals</a> in 2011. These state and metro area rankings offer information on community hospitals that are highly rated but may not be nationally ranked. Regional rankings are displayed for nearly every state and for the nation's largest metro areas, provided there is at least one Best Regional Hospital located there.<br/><br/>This year, 493 hospitals in 49 states and 92 metro areas were recognized as Best Regional Hospitals. There is no separate methodology report for the regional rankings, but additional information is contained at the end of the 2022-2023 U.S. News Best Hospitals Procedures &amp; Conditions Ratings <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BHPC-Methodology-2022-2023"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BHPC-Methodology-2022-2023&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Methodology Report</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>What defines a Best Regional Hospital?</b></h3><br/>A Best Regional Hospital is a hospital that:<br/><ul><li>Offers a full range of general medical and surgical services (as opposed to a specialty hospital).</li><li>Either was nationally ranked in one of the 11 data-driven Best Hospitals specialties (excluding rehabilitation) <i>or</i> had seven or more ratings of high performing in the Best Hospitals procedures and conditions. Note that for Best Regional Hospitals eligibility and scoring purposes, the TAVR and AVR cohorts were combined, and ovarian and uterine cancer surgeries were combined.</li><li>In addition to the eligibility criteria, a hospital must have had at least three more high-performing procedures/conditions than below-average procedures/conditions to be a Best Regional Hospital this year.</li></ul><ul></ul>Nationwide, 493 hospitals were identified as Best Regional Hospitals, compared with 531 last year. The Best Hospitals for Maternity was not included in the Best Regional Hospitals calculation.<br/><br/><h3><b>How was each Best Regional Hospital assigned its numerical ranking?</b></h3><br/>In a given region (state or major metro area), a hospital on the Best Hospitals Honor Roll outranked all other hospitals not on the Honor Roll, regardless of point totals. Other hospitals located in each region were ranked according to the number of points they earned: Hospitals earned two points for each of the 11 data-driven Best Hospitals specialties in which they were nationally ranked and one point for each of the 11 specialties (excluding rehabilitation) and 18 procedures and conditions in which they were rated high performing (AVR and TAVR are combined in this calculation, as are ovarian and uterine cancer surgery).<br/><br/>In addition, hospitals lost one point for each procedure or condition in which they were rated below average. In some circumstances, where a health system with multiple hospitals had consolidated a certain service at a regional center of excellence, we reassigned Best Regional Hospitals points for that service from the system's center of excellence to the system's flagship hospital.<br/><br/><h3><b>Can a specialty hospital, such as an orthopedic, cancer or children's hospital, be recognized as a Best Regional Hospital if it is nationally ranked or high performing?</b></h3><br/>No. The primary intent of the designation is to identify hospitals that perform well across a range of specialties, conditions and procedures. A specialty hospital's profile and its ratings and rankings pages show the area or areas of care in which it is ranked or high performing.<br/><br/><h3><b>In which metropolitan areas and states were hospitals ranked?</b></h3><br/>U.S. News generally used the U.S. Census Bureau list of Metropolitan Statistical Areas to define metro areas, but we departed from MSAs in cases where we used larger Combined Statistical Areas, or combined adjacent MSAs, to include nearby smaller cities with nationally ranked hospitals. For example, we used the Detroit CSA instead of the Detroit MSA; we combined the Durham-Chapel Hill and Raleigh-Cary MSAs to define the Raleigh-Durham metro area.<br/><br/>Some metropolitan areas, such as Cincinnati, Kansas City and New York, cross state lines. Washington, D.C. is included as a metro area but not a state.<br/><br/><h3><b>What about hospitals in smaller metro areas or outside metro areas?</b></h3><br/>U.S. News has grouped counties and county equivalents like parishes into approximately 200 regions that reflect geography, local custom and regional health care markets. High performers were recognized but not numerically ranked in regions that are not major metro areas.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why weren't children's hospitals ranked in metro areas?</b></h3><br/>Very few metro areas have more than one or two <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Children's Hospitals</a>. That makes decisions about where to go for expert pediatric care simpler than for adult care; ranking small numbers of children's hospitals within a metro area wouldn't offer meaningful assistance.

By evaluating hospitals using core maternity and perinatal care data, including data primarily self-reported by hospitals, and by publishing this information publicly on each hospital’s usnews.com page, we aim to enhance the transparency of the maternity services provided for uncomplicated pregnancies. How U.S. News evaluated hospitals is addressed in this FAQ and a comprehensive methodology report is available as a <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/best_hospitals_for_maternity_final_methodology_2022"">downloadable PDF</a>.<br/><br/>The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity"">Best Hospitals for Maternity</a> differs from other procedures and conditions in a few important ways:<br/><ul><li>Due to the lower age of the patients seeking maternity care, much of the data used in the methodology were collected directly from hospitals rather than from Medicare data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Due to this, only hospitals deemed high performing were recognized. Other hospitals that participated in the survey have a scorecard describing their performance on individual metrics but no recognition is displayed.</li><li>Alongside the quality assessment are factors many new parents look for when choosing where to have a baby.</li></ul><h3>How did U.S. News evaluate hospitals in Maternity Care?</h3><br/>Following U.S. News’ Best Hospitals rankings and the procedure and condition ratings, <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity"">Best Hospitals for Maternity</a> draws the quality of care from three categories: outcomes, process, and structure.<br/><ul><li>Outcomes: 60%.<br/><ul><li>C-section rates: 30%.</li><li>Newborn complications rates: 25%.</li><li>Episiotomy rates: 5%.</li></ul></li><li>Process: 35%.<br/><ul><li>Early elective delivery rates: 5%.</li><li>Exclusive breast milk feeding rates: 20%.</li><li>Vaginal birth after cesarean rates: 5%.</li><li>Transparency on racial/ethnic disparities: 5%.</li></ul></li><li>Structure: 5%.<br/><ul><li>Birthing-friendly practice: 5%.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>What data sources were used?</b></h3><br/>In the spring of 2022, U.S. News &amp; World Report invited hospitals that offer maternity care to self-report their maternity data to U.S. News via an online survey, the Maternity Services Survey, hosted on the <a  href=""https://hospitaldashboard.usnews.com"">U.S. News Hospital Dashboard</a>.<br/><br/>Primary data collection from hospitals was necessary because quality data available from other sources, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, were insufficient on their own to evaluate the quality of maternal and neonatal care. Data collection took place over two months and began on March 9, 2022.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""children-hospital"">2023-2024 Best Children's Hospitals,<b> Published June 2023</b></label></h2>What is the purpose of the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings"">Best Children's Hospitals</a> rankings? When should they be consulted? How are they determined? The following FAQ addresses these and other Best Children's Hospitals questions. A fully detailed methodology report is available as a <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BCH_Methodology_2023-2024.pdf"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""00000187-e88e-d02a-a38f-e98edf330000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-e88e-d02a-a38f-e98edf330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000015f-a0f5-d602-a57f-e3f7217a0000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BCH_Methodology_2023-2024.pdf&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">downloadable PDF</a>.<br/><br/>For the 2023-2024 rankings, U.S. News requested medical data and other information from nearly 200 facilities. Of those, 119 turned in enough data to be evaluated in at least one specialty, and 89 were ranked in one or more.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why does U.S. News rank children's hospitals?</b></h3><br/>Relatively few children, compared with the number of adults, face life-threatening or rare conditions or have to go through complicated operations. A typical hospital, where nearly all inpatients are adults, simply cannot provide the caliber of expertise needed by a severely ill child. Even a hospital with a busy maternity unit may not be equipped to deal with a newborn who weighs just a few pounds or requires surgery for a congenital heart defect. Similarly, most hospitals don't see large numbers of children with cancer, respiratory illnesses or kidney conditions.<br/><br/>Even among children's hospitals and large pediatric services that do, the reality – as true in pediatrics as in adult care – is that some hospitals are better than others. That's why in 2006, U.S. News began collecting data that would allow ranking of pediatric centers on their ability to help children who need it the most.<br/><br/><h3><b>How are the rankings organized and updated?</b></h3><br/>The 50 best-performing hospitals are ranked in each of 10 pediatric specialties. Unranked hospitals that provided enough information to be scored in a specialty are listed with their data but without rank or score. The rankings are updated annually in June. The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-childrens-hospitals/articles/best-childrens-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll</a> recognizes the 10 hospitals that received the highest number of points, based on the number of specialties in which they are ranked and how high they ranked in each.<br/><br/><h3><b>What are the 10 specialties?</b></h3><ul><li>Cancer.</li><li>Cardiology and heart surgery.</li><li>Diabetes and endocrinology.</li><li>Gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery.</li><li>Neonatology.</li><li>Nephrology.</li><li>Neurology and neurosurgery.</li><li>Orthopedics.</li><li>Pulmonology and lung surgery.</li><li>Urology.</li></ul><h3><b>So the rankings should just be a starting point?</b></h3><br/>Exactly. Families have to weigh many considerations when they seek care for a child, including the stress and expense of traveling to another city with a sick child and staying for days or possibly weeks, as well as an insurer's willingness to pay for care at a hospital outside its approved network.<br/><br/>Within a specialty, hospital performance is judged across a variety of conditions and procedures. So one hospital might outperform another in some of them, the second might do better in others. In the<a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/orthopedics"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/orthopedics&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}""> pediatric orthopedic rankings</a>, for example, one hospital might have an especially busy spina bifida clinic but doesn't treat complex fractures as efficiently as another hospital. Parents and caregivers must decide for themselves which factors they want to weigh more or less heavily. Kids and families are all different. There's no one-size-fits-all.<br/><br/><h3><b>How is each hospital evaluated?</b></h3><br/>A third of each hospital's score, or 33.3%, was tied to outcomes such as survival, infections and surgical complications. (In cardiology and heart surgery, outcomes counted for 38.3% because more and better data are available.) A hospital's reputation, based on an annual survey of pediatric specialists and subspecialists in each of the 10 specialties, made up another 10% (5% in cardiology and heart surgery).<br/><br/>The remaining portion of slightly more than 50% evaluated commitment to patient safety (such as the number of specific ways infections are minimized), excellence (such as the number of fellowship programs) and family centeredness (such as the degree to which families are involved in their children's care).<br/><h3></h3><h3><b>Why does U.S. News include hospital reputation?</b></h3><br/>Experts' opinions can reflect important information that isn't evident in objective measurements. That's especially true in a field as full of nuance and complexity like the medical care of very sick children. We feel the opinions of pediatric specialists add to the objective measures that form the basis for the rankings.<br/><br/><h3><b>How are the rankings organized?</b></h3><br/>In each of the 10 specialty areas, the 50 hospitals with the highest scores are ranked numerically based on their overall score. Keep in mind that a lower-ranked hospital may be better in certain specialties than a hospital with a higher overall ranking in that specialty – and, importantly, hospitals with different rankings may be effectively equivalent on the attributes that matter most to a particular family.<br/><br/>You can learn about the nuanced differences by comparing hospitals' detailed scorecards, which show many of the measures that went into hospital scores. Some measures, such as nurse-to-patient ratios, are common to all specialties. Others, like accreditation for bone marrow transplant, apply to just one or two specialties.<br/><br/>In addition to displaying performance information for the 50 ranked hospitals in each specialty, the same information is shown for unranked hospitals if they provided enough data through the clinical survey to be evaluated. The unranked hospitals are listed alphabetically.<br/><br/><h3><b>What are the regional Best Children's Hospital rankings?</b></h3><br/>Each hospital that's ranked in at least one pediatric specialty, with two uncommon exclusions described here, is also assigned a ranking in its state and the multi-state region (there are seven) to which the state belongs. These <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatrics-area"">regional rankings</a> are intended to help families identify excellent pediatric centers near home.<br/><br/>Exclusions: Specialty pediatric hospitals, such as those that exclusively treat cancer, are excluded from the regional rankings. Additionally, a hospital that reports data for a specialty jointly with another hospital does not receive credit from that specialty toward a regional ranking unless the hospital is deemed by U.S. News to be the lead or co-lead hospital in that multi-hospital reporting relationship. Non-lead hospitals may be regionally ranked only if they are ranked on their own in another specialty or are the lead hospital in a joint reporting relationship in another specialty.<br/><br/>A map accompanying <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/coming-this-year-to-best-childrens-hospitals-regional-rankings"">this article</a> shows the seven multi-state regions and which states each region comprises.<br/><br/><h3><b>What is the significance of the </b><a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-childrens-hospitals/articles/best-childrens-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><b>Honor Roll</b></a><b>?</b></h3><br/>The Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes 10 hospitals that are unusually competent in many specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>How is the Honor Roll determined?</b></h3><br/>Hospitals received points for being ranked in a specialty, and the 10 hospitals with the most points across the 10 specialties make up the Honor Roll. The first-ranked hospital in a specialty received 25 points, the second-ranked hospital received 24 points and so on, until reaching No. 21. All hospitals ranked 21 through 50 received five points. The Honor Roll would have been extended if multiple hospitals had tied for the tenth-most points overall.<br/><br/><h3><b>How did U.S. News choose which children's hospitals to evaluate?</b></h3><br/>Selection was determined initially by membership in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, or NACHRI, now called the Children's Hospital Association, or by nomination from teams of expert advisers. A hospital also can request to be considered. U.S. News makes such decisions not only on a hospital's willingness to engage in public reporting but also on the size and scope of its pediatric program.<br/><br/>Of approximately 200 hospitals U.S. News invites to participate in the survey each year, about a quarter of the hospitals are freestanding pediatric-focused facilities. Most of the others are pediatric departments within larger full-service hospitals and are so large that the department functions almost like its own hospital within a hospital – with its own staff, operating rooms and support services.<br/><br/><h3><b>Are there changes from last year?</b></h3><br/>Year to year, there are always changes – we constantly try to improve our methodology, using feedback we get from knowledgeable parents, doctors and health care leaders. Our approach is conservative, however, since any alterations in our analysis affect not only the new rankings but the ability to compare them with previous results. Some of this year's changes were highlighted in a <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2023-05-30/best-childrens-hospitals-coming-soon"" data-cms-id=""00000188-6ce5-d7e3-a1bc-6de50bc30005"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000188-6ce5-d7e3-a1bc-6de50bc30005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">U.S. News blog post</a> published shortly before the rankings were released.<br/><br/><h3><b>How does U.S. News decide what changes to make to the methodology?</b></h3><br/>RTI International, a large North Carolina-based research and consulting firm that created the Best Children's Hospitals methodology in 2006 (and the U.S. News contractor for the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Hospitals</a> rankings), works with experts organized into specialized working groups to review and update the methodology each year. U.S. News editors review proposed changes and approve them before they take effect.<br/><h3></h3><h3><b>Why does U.S. News ask hospitals for data instead of using existing data sources?</b></h3><br/>We use existing data whenever we can. The lack of critical data that can be tapped to evaluate children's hospitals has been a huge challenge. There is no pediatric equivalent of the Medicare database U.S. News mines to measure hospital performance in the annual Best Hospitals adult rankings and ratings.<br/><br/>In 2006, when U.S. News began looking into the possibility of ranking pediatric centers, children's hospitals had barely begun to develop standards for care-related quality data or how to best analyze the results. That is still largely the case, despite the meaningful progress pediatric researchers have made in certain areas of performance measurement.<br/><br/>So in 2006, U.S. News asked RTI to put together a clinical survey for children's hospitals. Some questions, such as nursing data and the extent and success of programs that prevent infection, touch on all 10 specialties. Others, such as complication rates of kidney biopsies and five-year survival rates for several types of cancer, are specialty-specific.<br/><br/><h3><b>What defines the three categories of quality measures – outcomes, process and structure – used in the rankings?</b></h3><br/><b>Outcomes</b><br/><br/>These data reflect a hospital's ability to keep children alive, keep them safe from harm by protecting them from infections and surgical complications and improve the quality of life of children with chronic conditions. For example, we evaluate survival from three types of childhood cancers, bloodstream infections caused by central line catheters and success in managing severe asthma cases.<br/><br/><b>Process</b><br/><br/>The intent of the U.S. News process measure is to evaluate how well and efficiently a hospital goes about the day-to-day business of delivering care. That is determined in part by compliance with widely endorsed ""best practices,"" such as regular morbidity and mortality conferences to explore unanticipated deaths or complications, and commitment to infection control, such as having certified infection preventionists on staff and tracking the correct use of antibiotics prior to surgery. Additionally, hospitals' efforts to advance equity, diversity and inclusion of patients and staff factor into the rankings.<br/><br/>It's important to have such programs, but they must deliver. So 10% of a hospital's score (5% in the cardiology and heart surgery rankings) relies on the opinions of pediatric specialists and subspecialists via an annual survey that asks them to name up to 10 hospitals in their specialty where they would send the sickest patients without taking location or expense into account. Responses are combined from the three latest surveys, meaning for the 2023-2024 rankings, surveys conducted in 2021, 2022 and 2023. More than 25,000 physicians were surveyed in 2022, and more than 6,000 responded.<br/><br/><b>Structure</b><br/><br/>This category reflects resources a hospital makes available to patients, like the number of nurses caring for patients. We collect information about 40 elements, many relevant to every specialty and others specific to just one. A few examples are the availability of surgery for <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-for-children-with-severe-congenital-heart-disease"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-for-children-with-severe-congenital-heart-disease&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">congenital heart defects</a> or for liver transplants, <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/diabetes-and-endocrinology"" data-cms-id=""00000154-bbbb-df1f-a7dd-ffbf88f00000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000154-bbbb-df1f-a7dd-ffbf88f00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;49eff7f3-c557-4db7-a38b-55aa7e5dfbb0&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">specialized clinics for children with diabetes</a> or kidney disease and services for families that ease the anxiety of a child's hospital stay.<br/><br/><b>For PR-related questions, please contact health-pr@usnews.com.</b>","hospitals, patient advice, patients","faqhospitalranking, Best Children's Hospitals, hospital FAQ, America's Best Hospitals, hospital overview, BCH Launch 2023",Wed Jun 21 00:01:00 EDT 2023,Richard Nigro

RTI International, a North Carolina-based research and consulting firm that also generates the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals"" title=""Link: https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals"">Best Hospitals</a> rankings, administered both surveys and analyzed the results.

Doctors were asked to name up to 10 hospitals they consider best in their specialty&nbsp;for children with serious or difficult medical problems.

A year ago, Montana’s registered reserves of $2.3 billion, exceeding estimated by $1 billion.<br/><br/>And, the state took the unusual step in March of paying off its 2023 general obligation bond debt, making Montana debt-free and saving its residents $40 million in borrowing costs over two years.<br/><br/>“After providing Montanans with over $1 billion in tax relief, we’re going to invest our surplus responsibly like any Montana family would, making needed repairs and paying off our debt,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in announcing the move. “Today, we’re making Montana debt-free in ‘23, saving Montanans $40 million over the next two years. We’re also investing $100 million from our surplus to repair our roads and bridges, leveraging federal dollars for critical infrastructure projects.”<br/><br/>To compile its rankings, Conning relies on 13 metrics, including gross domestic product adjusted for inflation, GDP per capita, employment growth and the state’s unemployment rate.

You'll need to have at least $30,000 worth of loans through the direct loan program or the Federal Family Education Loan, or FFEL, program to qualify for the federal extension.<br/><br/>Opting for a longer student loan repayment term will help lower your payments, but it will take you more time to get out of debt. Importantly, extending your student loan repayment term will cost you more money in the long run, since you'll pay more in interest over time.<br/><br/><h3>Graduated Repayment Plan</h3><br/>Under the <a  href=""https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/graduated"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/graduated&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Graduated Repayment Plan</a>, your monthly payments start out lower and increase every two years.

Under this plan, your payments can decrease or increase based on your annual income, with a maximum repayment period of 10 years.

While the latter half of 2023 may see a recession, mortgage interest rates are expected to stabilize and some buyers may be able to return to the market with renewed buying power. Buyers who have been in their homes for at least a few years can expect to see that their property value has grown – though it may look less thrilling than the peaks of 2021.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence about selling, you have a few choices: You can <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/the-guide-to-selling-your-home"">put your house up for sale</a> to take advantage of current low inventory, you can wait to see how interest rates and inflation play out as they relate to housing or you can opt to stay in your current home for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Here are three reasons you shouldn’t sell your home in 2023, along with three reasons it’s a good idea to make the jump in the next 12 months:<br/><ul><li><a  href=""#1"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;#1&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Wait to sell: You bought or refinanced in the last couple of years.</a></li><li><a  href=""#2"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;#2&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Wait to sell: You’re worried about affording your next purchase</a>.</li><li><a  href=""#3"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;#3&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Wait to sell: You're worried about finding your next home</a>.<br/></li><li><a  href=""#4"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;#4&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Sell in 2023: A high interest rate doesn’t scare you</a>.</li><li><a  href=""#5"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;#5&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Sell in 2023: You understand your home's value</a>.</li><li><a  href=""#6"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;#6&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Sell in 2023: You need to move</a>.</li></ul><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000171-9d69-d4e3-aff9-9dfb63040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7c95-d306-a57f-7ddd60d10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : The Guide to Making a Contingent Offer on a House (https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/the-guide-to-making-a-contingent-offer-on-a-house)</usn-enhancement><h2><label  data-id=""1"">Wait to Sell: You Bought or Refinanced in the Last Couple of Years</label></h2>If you’re one of the many homeowners who have moved or refinanced in the last few years, there’s no reason to consider selling your home in the immediate future. Hopefully, your <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/loans/mortgages/best-mortgage-lenders"">mortgage </a>has helped ease any financial woes with low monthly payments.<br/><br/>Ahead of 2022, many homeowners were able to lock into mortgage rates below 3%, which makes selling any time in the near future far less attractive. Unless other factors are making a move necessary, enjoy the low interest rate you locked in and continue to build equity in your home.<br/><br/>Mortgage rates have risen and dropped many times during the first half of 2023, but have remained below the peak of 7.08% for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage in November 2022, according to Freddie Mac. As of June 15, Freddie Mac reported the average interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.69%. <br/><br/>But if you managed to secure an interest rate below 3% – or even 2%, for some homeowners – you’ll see little incentive to more than triple your interest rate for a new home.<br/><br/>You won’t be the only homeowner feeling locked into your property based on mortgage rates. “That’s likely to keep a lid on how much inventory growth we’re going to see,” says Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. <br/><h2><label  data-id=""2"">Wait to Sell: You’re Worried About Affording Your Next Purchase</label></h2>Over the course of the last couple of years, worries about affording your next <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-buy-a-house"">home purchase</a> were tied to the <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/your-guide-to-the-housing-market"">housing market’s</a> rising prices and lack of new homes for sale. Now, add interest rates between 6% and 7% to the mix, and there seems to be little financial benefit to buying a new home. Don’t be afraid to wait to sell your home if you think the timing isn’t right.<br/><br/>Even with plenty of home equity, you may find that your buying power is diminished when you factor in how much more you would have to pay toward interest each month.<br/><br/>“That’s a tough financial calculus, and that’s keeping the more discretionary sellers out of the market right now,” says Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist for multiple listing service Bright MLS. <br/><br/>If you can’t afford the home you would want to have next, it makes sense to wait to put your house on the market.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016b-41b1-d597-a17f-7fb5c8dc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7c95-d306-a57f-7ddd60d40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : How to Tactfully Back Out of a Real Estate Deal.

Plenty of other homeowners are opting not to list their home for the time being, and while there are fewer buyers than there were in the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, more are coming back to the market than you may expect.<br/><br/>“In the spring of this year we saw buyers come back. Newly pending listings have ticked up,” says Orphe Divounguy, senior economist for Zillow. <br/><br/>Shopping for a new home is still easier than it was in 2021 because you’re less likely to have to compete with as many multiple offers and bids well above the asking price. But there were more than 24% fewer new listings in May 2023 compared with May 2022, according to Zillow. With fewer homes on the market to choose from, you may struggle to find the right number of bedrooms, ideal location or overall feel that will make you willing to take on a higher interest rate. <br/><br/>“The market’s still very competitive,” Divounguy says.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""4"">Sell in 2023: A High Interest Rate Doesn’t Scare You</label></h2><br/>Mortgage rates reached higher levels in 2022 than in recent memory. For many homeowners, that’s enough to opt to stay in their current house. For others, the interest rate isn’t as much of a concern.<br/><br/>“There may be buyers that are not as rate sensitive,” says Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede, a Philadelphia-based wealth management firm. You may be a cash buyer without plans to finance your next house at all, or you may have enough equity in your current home to feel confident you can buy down your next mortgage rate to a more attractive level. <br/><br/>The more prolonged period of interest rates above 6% has also given many would-be homebuyers the opportunity to adjust to the prospect of higher mortgage costs – it may require an adjusted budget, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t make a purchase.<br/><br/>“Buyers seem to be OK with the idea that 7% is the norm, not the exception,” Divounguy says.<br/><br/>Plus, at the end of the day there is no way to perfectly time the market. If you can afford to move and want to move, selling your home in 2023 may be the best timing when there’s no way to know what’s ahead in 2024 and beyond.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""5"">Sell in 2023: You Understand Your Home's Value</label></h2><br/>Many housing markets across the U.S. are still seeing plenty of buyer interest, but properties aren’t getting the regular bidding wars and sky-high sale prices they were in 2021. If you sell your home in 2023, buyers will be less inclined to offer above the asking price – and they may not look at all if the asking price is too much.<br/><br/>Divounguy explains that the houses selling fast today and receiving more than one offer are those that are priced to sell and offer all the marketing bells and whistles, like a 3D home tour and professional photography.<br/><br/>Unless your real estate agent says otherwise based on recent sales in your area, you’re unlikely to get $100,000 above the asking price for your starter home without an appraisal contingency. With buyers looking carefully at their budgets, they’ll be making serious offers based on what makes sense for their budget and what they believe your home is worth.<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016a-b417-ddb8-a97a-b79772690000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-7c95-d306-a57f-7ddd60d60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : Everything You Need to Know About a Pending Home Sale (https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-a-pending-home-sale)</usn-enhancement><h2><label  data-id=""6"">Sell in 2023: You Need to Move</label></h2><br/>If you <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-move-to-a-new-home-during-the-pandemic"">need to move</a> for any reason, it’s still possible to sell your home and find a new one. If you lost your job, you may be worried about your ability to continue to pay your mortgage. If that’s the case, selling may be a valid option. But plenty of others are opting for a life change that involves moving to another state, more room for a growing family or a bigger footprint needed for permanent <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-set-up-a-home-office"">work-from-home space</a>.<br/><br/>A profitable sale and purchase of a new home is still possible – but proper preparation and realistic expectations are key.<br/><br/>Additionally, change in conditions can open doors for buyers to come back to the market – particularly if mortgage interest rates shift down further and if inflation continues to decline. If a recession occurs in the latter half of 2023 as experts predict, a drop in mortgage rates could help buyers get back in the market.<br/><br/>However, don’t expect the Federal Reserve to be too eager to drop rates suddenly in the event of an economic downturn. While mortgage interest rates are technically independent of the Fed’s funds rate, they often reflect changes. “The Fed’s going to be very careful not to reignite inflation that has become very sticky,” says Reynolds, who anticipates mortgage rates to remain on the high end where they’ve been through the end of the year.<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1639513436739,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000174-8bb4-d168-af7f-ffff22670000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1639513436739,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000174-8bb4-d168-af7f-ffff22670000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000177-d09e-d052-a1f7-dadf0e2c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff7000f&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;showTitleOnEmbed&quot;:true,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-ba9d-d405-a17f-febdb3ea0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;04a89d22-d3e6-3558-ab54-be22c9c29555&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;0000017d-ba9d-de4d-a97d-bfbf5cf00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Listicle : 15 Secrets to Selling Your Home Faster (210225realestate.sellingyourhomefaster)</usn-enhancement>","real estate, housing market, home prices, housing, housing starts, existing home sales, pending home sales, new home sales, mortgages, interest rates",coronavirus-money,Tue Jun 20 12:47:19 EDT 2023,Devon Thorsby

They have only losses.”<br/><br/>Zelenskyy’s positive assessment aligns with the need of any embattled government to maintain national morale and to affirm confidence in top military commanders’ plans – but also to reassure Western benefactors eagerly watching what the newly empowered Ukrainian military is capable of doing with their months-long, multibillion-dollar investments.<br/><br/>Yet despite broad calls for patience with what will surely be a drawn-out campaign and reassurances from military commentators that all large offensives begin with stumbles and probing skirmishes, a growing chorus of analysts and Western officials now observe that Russia is holding fast – and is taking new ground in some limited locations.<br/><br/>The realities represent a perhaps inevitable shift in the tone of the war. The first few months of President Vladimir Putin’s invasion were defined by embarrassing failures on the part of a Russian military charging at targets only to be cut down by Ukraine’s defenders or to collapse under its own dysfunction.<br/><br/>Now, the invading troops can capitalize on the months they’ve spent entrenching their fallback positions, bolstering their defenses and building traps that snarl Ukraine’s new attacks.<br/><br/>British military intelligence concluded in an assessment over the weekend that Russia is employing “relatively effective defensive operations,” referencing a spike in fighting in the south – considered one of the regions Ukraine was expected to prioritize early in the counteroffensive.

A lot is happening as the Ukrainians are trying to find the penetration points,” Keane said. “That takes time.

For example, The Knot study found the average cost in Oklahoma was $16,000, while in New York it was $46,000.<br/><br/>Of course, the more elaborate your plans are, the more it will cost.

Twenty-nine percent say they planned to optimize credit cards, 26% said they would money they saved and another 24% said they'd include cash funds on their registries to cover the costs.<br/><br/><h2><b>Define Your Wedding Budget</b></h2><br/>The first thing Mindy Rossignol, owner and lead planner at Private Weddings and Events in New Hampshire, does with a couple at the outset of the planning process is prioritize. She asks couples to rank categories on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest. These categories might include flowers, food and music.<br/><br/>From this point, couples can begin to<a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/my-money/articles/what-is-a-budget""> build a budget</a>. And according to Rossignol, it's critical that couples do this before booking venues or vendors for the wedding because the process involves isolating what's truly important to them.<br/><br/>""I say, 'OK look, you do not have enough money in this category for a band, so where do we want to pull from?' Say we pull from flowers. You're going to lose a few extra arrangements,'"" Rossignol says. <br/><br/>""We work out the full budget before we start booking anything because that's where a lot of people get into trouble. They'll go book their dream venue and realize they spent 70% of their budget and don't have enough money left over for everything else,” she adds.<br/><br/>If you will be receiving financial assistance from relatives, that money may not be enough to cover all the expenses. Rossignol says it's common to see couples get help from families but make up the difference by saving for high-priority items like a band instead of a DJ, which would be much less expensive.<br/><br/><h2><b>Factor in Inflation</b></h2><br/>Developing a budget will give you a target savings goal, but you should also <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/family-finance/articles/tips-to-make-ends-meet-during-high-inflation"">anticipate rising prices</a>. Work on the assumption that the things you want will cost 5% to 10% more a year or two from now.<br/><br/>Amy Richardson, certified financial planner with Schwab Intelligent Portfolios Premium, says getting a jump-start on saving can make all the difference.

For example, maybe you have a year to plan your wedding. If you were to put $10,000 in a 12-month CD with an APY of 5.41%, the earned interest would be $541. That would take a bite out of your wedding cake bill.<br/><br/><h2><b>Be Willing to Make Some Sacrifices</b></h2><br/>If a pricey wedding is truly your top priority, it may be time to sacrifice a few things to make it a reality. For instance, you may want to wait a little longer to have the wedding until you actually have the funds. <br/><br/>“One more year of budgeting, working and saving can put more cash in your pocket to have the wedding of your dreams,” Pham says.<br/><br/>As a team, you and your partner should also decide what you’re willing to forgo when there simply isn’t enough cash available to have it all.<br/><br/>“If having a sit-down dinner for your wedding is a high priority, consider how you might be able to save in other areas, such as choosing a DJ over a live band, etc.,” Richardson wrote in an email. <br/><br/>“Life is about trade-offs, and there are no right or wrong answers. The key takeaway is we can’t always have everything we want, exactly the way we want it. It is about compromise and recognizing that the decisions you make today have a large impact on your future – you don’t want to jeopardize your long-term financial wellness and other important goals,” she wrote.<br/><br/>Finally, try to relax. <br/><br/>“Planning a wedding is so overwhelming with a lot of financial and mental stress,” Pham says. “It’s likely the biggest party of your life but if you get caught up in the details you'll drive yourself crazy. It’s not always the décor or party favors that people remember but the more heartfelt moments.”<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686766203536,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-8b7c-d687-a787-8bfd823a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686766203536,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-8b7c-d687-a787-8bfd823a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-64b0-df4c-a17b-7ebf94220001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;promoText&quot;:&quot;RELATED CONTENT&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-bb19-d0b9-a9d9-fb9bb43e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;8eebe97b-8898-32af-87c4-e35cec8ee4bd&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-bb19-d4a7-a9b8-fffd57d00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Article : Affordable Wedding Venue Ideas (220823personalfinance.weddingvenues) (1 PV)</usn-enhancement>","money, personal finance, personal budgets",,Tue Jun 20 12:05:04 EDT 2023,"Erica Sandberg, Barri Segal, Emma Kerr"

In other words, you can offer to pay some or all of the amount owed in exchange for the debt collector removing it from your reports. <br/><br/>While a pay-for-delete request is unlikely to work with the original creditor, a third-party debt collection agency might be more amenable. Though don't be surprised if the debt collector refuses: Removing an accurately reported item from a credit report may violate its reporting agreement with the credit bureaus.<br/><br/>A delinquent bill doesn't go to collections right away. Once a bill goes unpaid for a length of time – often, around 180 days – it's considered <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/what-happens-when-you-stop-making-credit-card-payments"">seriously</a> <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/what-happens-when-you-stop-making-credit-card-payments"">delinquent</a>. At that point, the creditor is likely to decide it isn't worth the time and cost to continually try to collect the debt and instead will sell it to a collection agency for a fraction of the total amount owed. <br/><br/>In turn, the collection agency will take over and attempt to collect the payment from you.<br/><br/>A bill sent to collections will <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/how-long-do-my-mistakes-stay-on-my-credit-report"">stay on your credit report</a> for seven years from the date of first delinquency.

(https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/secured)</usn-enhancement><h2>How Pay-for-Delete Affects Your Credit</h2>Even one missed payment can have a negative effect on your credit, but allowing a bill to get to the point of being sent to collections is especially harmful. Pay-for-delete could improve your score by removing a negative entry from your credit, <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/will-paying-off-a-collection-amount-improve-your-credit-score"" data-cms-id=""0000016a-373b-d690-af7f-ff3b70a50000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016a-373b-d690-af7f-ff3b70a50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">but how much will it help</a>? <br/><br/>""This will be different for everyone, as each person's credit file is different,"" Lane says. ""However, a successful removal of a derogatory collection account from a credit report should generally improve the credit score.""<br/><br/>That said, the positive effects could be minimal if you have multiple accounts in collections.<br/><br/>Donald E. Petersen, an Orlando, Florida-based consumer protection lawyer, says, ""Unless all of the consumer's debt collectors agree to and follow through on the pay-for-delete, the consumer may still have adverse trade lines dragging down their credit score substantially."" <br/><br/>Petersen also warns that some less reputable collection agencies will accept payment and then fail to remove the negative item. It's important to get the agreement in writing, which he says could be enforced in court. <br/><br/>Finally, note that if you're negotiating with a collection agency, a pay-for-delete will only remove the collection account. The original debt, plus any late or missed payment information, will still appear on your credit report. That means that even if you successfully negotiate a pay-for-delete agreement, it might not make much difference overall.<br/><br/><h2>Pay-for-Delete Becoming Obsolete</h2>Even if you could theoretically negotiate a successful pay-for-delete agreement, it may not be worth the trouble in many cases. Newer credit score models, including FICO 9 and VantageScore 3.0, ignore collections accounts that have been paid off. So they essentially consider these accounts as deleted, even though they technically still show up on your reports. <br/><br/>Lane also notes that for those with delinquent medical debt, there have been a few helpful updates in the past couple of years to how it's reported. For one, there is now a 12-month delay before an unpaid medical collections debt can show up on a person's credit report, rather than just six months previously. <br/><br/>""This gives a consumer more time to resolve the debt and more time for insurance to process it,"" Lane says. Additionally, credit bureaus no longer report medical collections that have been resolved. ""The credit bureaus will automatically delete a medical debt that has been paid in full or settled for less than the amount due,"" he says. Finally, credit bureaus will no longer report medical debts below $500. <br/><br/><h2>How to Write a Pay-for-Delete Letter&nbsp;</h2>If you decide to pursue a pay-for-delete arrangement, the next step is writing a pay-for-delete letter and sending it to the creditor or debt collector.<br/><br/>In the letter, you should explicitly state that you're offering to pay the debt in full or settle a portion of it in exchange for having it removed from your credit report. Before sending any payment, be sure to get a written agreement back that acknowledges the terms of your deal.<br/><br/>There are plenty of templates online of pay-for-delete letters you can use. In general, your letter should include the following:<br/><ul><li>Your name and address.</li><li>The date.</li><li>The creditor or collection agency's name and address.</li><li>Your account number.</li><li>Proposed payoff amount and terms of the pay-for-delete.</li><li>Payment method if an agreement is reached.</li><li>Request for written and signed acknowledgement.&nbsp;</li><li>Deadline for the creditor to respond.</li><li>Your signature.<br/></li></ul><h2>Alternatives to Pay-for-Delete</h2>Because of the downsides, Petersen says that some consumers are better off pursuing options other than pay-for-delete. <br/><br/><a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-finding-and-fixing-credit-report-errors""><b>Dispute the error</b></a><b>. </b>If you have an account in collections because of an error, you certainly shouldn't resort to requesting a pay-for-delete arrangement to get rid of it. You should dispute the error with each of the three credit bureaus. You can do this online or through certified mail. Once you submit a dispute, the credit bureau has 30 days to investigate your claim with the creditor. If it turns out there was indeed an error, the bureau is legally required to remove the entry from your report.<br/><br/><b>Request that the debt be verified. </b>Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, debt collectors are required to provide proof that you truly owe the debt in question. Within the first five days of contacting you, the collector must provide a debt validation letter, which will state your right to dispute the debt within 30 days. You must do so in writing. After that, the collector must then prove it owns the debt, you owe the debt, what you owe and other details. If the collection agency isn't able to provide this information, you aren't required to pay and could dispute the error to have it removed from your report.<br/><br/><b>Pay the bill, even without a pay-for-delete offer.</b> If you are able to get a pay-for-delete from a collection agency, it may help your credit. But the delinquent account with the original creditor will still remain on your credit report.

""Consumers who offer a pay-for-delete have drawn the debt collector's attention to their financial situation,"" Petersen says. In other words, the debt collector now knows that you have the cash on hand to pay your debt. The collector might turn down your pay-for-delete request and instead ramp up efforts to collect what you owe. <br/><br/>""Some consumers should let sleeping dogs lie, especially if they do not plan to buy a house or a car in the immediate future, or if the <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/steps-to-remove-a-charge-off-from-your-credit-report"">charge-off</a> is more than 3 years old,"" Petersen says. The charge-off will age off your credit report after seven years. <br/><br/>Additionally, smaller debts tend to have less impact on your credit; amounts less than $100 may have no negative effect at all, depending on the scoring model. The same is true for certain types of medical debt. If this is the case, a pay-for-delete is probably not necessary. <br/><br/>However, keep in mind that just because a debt is removed from your credit report or doesn't affect your credit score doesn't remove any legal obligation to pay it.<br/><br/>Another important thing to keep in mind is that if the creditor or debt collector accepts a partial payment as payment in full (known as debt settlement), it is obligated to report it to the IRS as <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/the-truth-about-credit-card-debt-forgiveness"">debt forgiveness</a> if the forgiven amount is more than $600, according to Petersen. In most cases, forgiven debt is considered taxable income, which must be reported and paid in full that tax year.<br/><br/>In summary, pay-for-delete won't harm your credit. However, it could be a time-consuming process that yields few results, if any. And as newer credit scoring models are adopted, the practice may become completely unnecessary.<br/>","credit, credit scores",,Tue Jun 20 09:40:40 EDT 2023,"Casey Bond, Emily Hayes, Ray Frager "

The order also leaves open the possibility of continuances based on the complexity of the case and issues around classified documents and security clearances.<br/><br/>But perhaps more importantly, Cannon’s order requires pre-trial motions to be filed in just over a month, on July 24. That deadline could prove tricky for Trump to meet as he continues to scramble to assemble a legal team to defend him. His current lawyers also reportedly do not yet have security clearance to view the classified documents at the center of the case.<br/><br/>Cannon’s order is her first major action since Trump was arraigned last week on 37 felony counts. Cannon has faced calls for her recusal because of Trump-friendly rulings she previously made in the documents investigation, which were later forcefully struck down by a federal appeals court. She has so far resisted those calls, and Tuesday’s order is the latest sign that she has no intention of stepping away from the case.<br/><br/>Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury earlier this month on charges that include willful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, corruptly concealing a document or record, concealing a document in a federal investigation, scheme to conceal and making false statements.<br/><br/>Prosecutors says that Trump held on to a cache of incredibly sensitive, classified national security materials after leaving office; stored them in areas accessible to the public; refused to turn the documents back over to the government; hatched and executed a plan to hide documents from his lawyers and the government in defiance of a federal subpoena; and, in two separate incidents, knowingly showed classified documents to people who did not have clearance to see such information.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1687272175723,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000015e-9602-d50b-adde-deeff9930000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1687272175723,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000015e-9602-d50b-adde-deeff9930000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000142-9533-d538-abe7-9f3f6f300000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff7000b&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-d941-dd71-a3ce-fb6ff2510000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Cartoon Gallery : Editorial Cartoons on Donald Trump (120531cartoons.donaldtrump) (486 PV)</usn-enhancement>Trump’s legal team is expected to challenge several aspects of the indictment before a trial gets underway, including an order from a federal judge that allowed prosecutors to pierce attorney client privilege and question Trump’s ex-attorney Evan Corcoran.

A conviction on the charges, which could include prison time, could upend that race.

""Aspiring lawyers need to think about their social and emotional skills, their personal resilience, as well as their intellectual skills. ... We also have an obligation to all legal institutions and to the democratic system. Young people who have a strong sense of ethical obligation, personal integrity and commitment to justice, I think those are really important attributes."" <br/><h2>Step 2: Develop Communication and Reasoning Skills and a Strong Work Ethic</h2>After determining that the legal profession is a good fit, students should look for academic and extracurricular experiences that will help them develop skills necessary  to be a great lawyer. <br/><br/>Because law schools do not require specific undergraduate coursework – applicants hail from all academic backgrounds – potential attorneys have the flexibility to take the college courses that interest them most. <br/><br/>Steven Freedman, associate dean of admissions at the <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-kansas-03060"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-kansas-03060&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">University of Kansas School of Law</a>, advises aspiring lawyers to take at least several upper-level humanities classes, since reading, writing and research skills developed in those courses are critical to most legal jobs.<br/><br/>Courses in social science are also helpful, since they cultivate societal awareness and teach people skills. It's also beneficial to take analytical courses of some sort, whether in philosophy or science, technology, engineering or math – <a  href=""//www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2019-01-24/a-guide-to-stem-majors"" data-cms-id=""00000168-7596-d6ad-a1fb-75ff2fa30001"" data-cms-href=""//www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2019-01-24/a-guide-to-stem-majors"">STEM</a> fields – since logical reasoning is a fundamental component of the legal profession.<br/><br/>""I actually don't think that students are helped much by taking some kind of a pre-law curriculum in undergrad,"" Sugin says. ""What law students need to do is read carefully, think critically and communicate effectively. Those are the three most important things."" <br/><br/>One great way to prepare for a career as a lawyer is to get involved with a speech and debate team or a mock trial team. Those extracurricular activities can help students learn to argue persuasively, lawyers explain, adding that drama also provides solid preparation for a legal career since the performing arts emphasize public speaking skills.<br/><br/>Even an activity that doesn't initially appear to be related to the practice of law, such as playing a sport, writing for a school newspaper or doing volunteer work, could prove useful to aspiring attorneys if it helps them develop personal discipline and collaboration skills. <br/><h2>Step 3: Study for the LSAT or GRE</h2>The Law School Admission Test, or <a  href=""//www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/lsat-test-prep"" data-cms-id=""00000142-928c-d33c-abc6-ff9d04060000"" data-cms-href=""//www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/lsat-test-prep"">LSAT</a>, is the traditional law school entrance exam, the one that most prospective law students take in order to qualify for law school.

While the idea might entice some, for others it can be stressful – and, for plus-size travelers, there's more to that.

The thought of air travel for some plus-size travelers is enough to deter them from going. Recently, the aviation industry has received scrutiny for the size of seats on airplanes. If this is one of your travel concerns, don't fret. There are options out there for plus-size travelers when it comes to seat belt extenders and policies for those of size.<br/><br/>""Airplane seats are far too small. There needs to be a minimum size established, and it needs to be larger than the current sizing,"" one person said in the public comments on the Federal Aviation Administration's filing about the size of commercial airplane seats for safety. In March 2022, the FAA submitted a report to Congress stating that the current rules and standards are not providing adequate safety for air passengers.<br/><br/>Currently, economy seats on major airlines are anywhere from 16 to almost 18 inches in width for air passengers. That number may go as far as 22 inches for first class, business or premium seats on these airlines. In contrast, the average size of women is a size 16, according to a study in the International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology and Education.<br/><br/>While the FAA might be catching up to the issue of airline seat sizing, those in the plus-size community have been commenting on this subject for a while. Plus-size blogger Jae'lynn Chaney recently started a <a  href=""https://www.change.org/p/demand-for-the-faa-to-protect-plus-size-travelers"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.change.org/p/demand-for-the-faa-to-protect-plus-size-travelers&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Change.org petition</a> to get the FAA to change its policies when it comes to those ""customers of size.""<br/><br/>The petition asks for accessible additional seats for plus-size travelers, reimbursement, clear communication, accommodations for those who have accessibility needs and employee training. Chaney states in her petition: ""Air travel should be comfortable and accessible for everyone, regardless of size.""<br/><br/>Chaney is not the only one blogging and posting about discrimination when it comes to plus-size travel. On TikTok alone, there are more than 260 million posts under the hashtags #flyingwhilefat and #plussizetraveltok, which give advice and detail the issues plus-size travelers run into on their adventures.<br/><br/>One of the top posts is advice on how to deal with a seat belt extender when flying.<br/><br/><h2>How do I know if I need an airplane seat belt extender?</h2>For plus-size travelers, airplane seats can be very uncomfortable whether the flight is short or long. According to a 2020 report by TripSavvy, seat belt lengths range anywhere between 31 and 51 inches, depending on the airline you're flying.<br/><br/>One of the best things travelers can do before taking off is research. Prior to your flight, try to get the details of the aircraft you'll be flying in. You can do this by contacting the airline directly or looking for a diagram of the plane's layout and seat dimensions on the airline's website.<br/><br/>Once you board your flight and buckle yourself in, ask for a seat belt extender if the belt feels tight around you.<br/><br/><h2>How can I ask for a seat belt extender?</h2>For some, asking for a seat belt extender is not an easy feat. Remember that it's okay if you need to ask for one – requesting a seat belt extender is for your safety.<br/><br/>If you are one of the first to board, you can ask the flight attendant for a belt as you head to your seat. If you are not able to be an early boarder, try to grab an aisle seat and reach out to an attendant for an extended safety belt.<br/><br/>""For a person who already experiences discrimination and marginalization for their body size, not fitting into a seat belt can feel like confirmation that their body is somehow wrong, bad and unworthy, and has no value,"" said therapist Katie Piel to HuffPost.<br/><br/>For some, the stress and anxiety of asking might be too much, in which case you may want to bring your own personal seat belt extender.<br/><br/><h2>Can I use my own seat belt extender?</h2>While the FAA advises airlines not to allow personal seat belt extenders, this has not stopped travelers from purchasing their own just simply because they feel more comfortable bringing a belt than asking for one.<br/><br/>Airlines do provide seat belt extenders on flights as they are required by law to do so at no charge. Travelers are discouraged from bringing their own seat belt extenders, since the FAA would not be able to ensure that extenders brought by passengers are compliant with safety regulations.<br/><br/>According to the FAA: ""Seat belts and extenders provided by the airlines are inspected and maintained under each of the airline's FAA-accepted Continuous Airworthiness Maintenance Program (CAMP)."" The FAA has not tested or approved any third-party seat belt extenders on the market.<br/><br/><h2>What type of seat belt extender do I need?</h2>There are generally two types of seat belt extenders that customers should familiarize themselves with: Type A and Type B. The difference between the two is the mechanisms in belt design. Type A is designed for the universal seat belt that most airlines use – about 95% of airplane seat belts are manufactured by the Arizona-based AmSafe. The seat belts on Southwest Airlines, as the only major carrier not served by AmSafe, would typically fit with Type B extenders instead.<br/><br/>When you're browsing seat belt extenders online, the companies should indicate which airlines are compatible with a particular product.<br/><br/><h2>What else do I need to know?</h2>Travelers who do need seat belt extenders should keep in mind that some airlines have policies about where customers can sit. For example, Alaska Airlines prohibits travelers who are sitting in the exit rows from using a seat belt extender, while Spirit Airlines states that those who use a seat belt extender cannot sit in a seat with an inflatable seat belt. Check with the airline to find out if you need to sit in a certain seat to use an extender.<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1683301780183,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1683301780183,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-5200-da2a-a7f8-f22e8c970000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ffa001a&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000187-ec9a-d6a0-a58f-ffffa1da0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Raw HTML : Memorable Meanderings</usn-enhancement><br/><h2>The Top Seat Belt Extender Options</h2>If you still feel uncomfortable asking for an extender, here are a few seat belt extender options to purchase online.

Most major airlines have a customer of size policy. Airlines such as Southwest and Alaska will refund your ticket after travel if you purchase a second seat.<br/><br/>Other air companies such as American Airlines require travelers to purchase an extra seat. Delta Air Lines doesn't mandate this if you need a seat belt extender, but the airline will move your seat or make you take a later flight if another passenger doesn't have enough room.<br/><br/>If you wait until the day of the flight, you may be asked to take a later flight, so book that extra seat if need be. Check with the airline you're flying on to learn more about its customer of size policies.<br/><br/><h2>Why Trust U.S. News Travel</h2><a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/suzanne-mason"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017e-21f0-d441-a1fe-e1f451a60000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-21f0-d441-a1fe-e1f451a60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff7000e&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}""><b>Suzanne Mason</b></a> is a travel editor at U.S. News with a love of travel.

He has ordered the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons to Belarus, one of its sole remaining loyal post-Soviet allies and has engaged in other provocative behavior, such as <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2023-01-04/russia-to-sail-hypersonic-missiles-into-atlantic-ocean-in-clear-affront-to-u-s"">deploying ships armed with hypersonic missiles</a> – which U.S. analysts believe could carry a nuclear warhead – into the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Less catastrophic, but equally perilous for Ukraine, others fear that the mere threats of using nuclear weapons could amount to enough to force Kyiv’s allies in Europe to begin backing away from staunch support for its military, particularly as it escalates its spring offensive.<br/><br/>Other analysts tell U.S. News the possibility Putin would use nuclear weapons is remote, but not impossible.<br/><br/>“The likelihood of Russia choosing – or Putin choosing – to use nuclear weapons directly against the West is astronomically low.

However, because USAA is not available to members of the general public, No. 2 American Family may be the best choice for many drivers. State Farm, Geico, and Nationwide are also among the top companies in our rating.<br/><br/>However, the best car insurance company for you will depend on multiple factors, including your age, location, driving record, as well as the features that are most important to you, whether that’s excellent customer service, a notable reputation, or efficient claims handling.<br/><br/>Part of our analysis includes a survey of current policyholders for each of our top car insurance companies. Read on to see how existing customers rated their car insurance providers in a number of customer service-oriented categories.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Best for Customer Service: USAA, American Family, and State Farm</h3>USAA is ranked No. 1 in the Customer Service subcategory, while American Family and State Farm are tied at No. 2.<br/><br/>Our survey found that over 73% of USAA customers who have not filed a claim consider themselves completely satisfied with the customer service provided by the company. That number drops to 53% among USAA customers who have filed a claim. Since USAA’s car insurance policies are only available to members of the military community and their families, most customers will want to consider other insurers in our rating.<br/><br/>More than 65% of American Family customers who have not filed a claim expressed total satisfaction with the level of customer service provided, and the number is just under 58% among policyholders who have filed a claim. Those numbers among State Farm customers who responded to our survey are roughly 60% and 54%, respectively.<br/><br/>Nationwide, Geico, Travelers, and Farmers tied at No. 4 in this subcategory.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Best for Claims Handling: American Family</h3>American Family is rated No. 1 in the Claims Handling subcategory with a score of 4.3, edging out No. 2 USAA, which earned a score of 4.2. Our survey results show that over 61% of American Family policyholders consider themselves completely satisfied with the ease of filing a claim, and 56% are completely satisfied with how their claims were resolved.<br/><br/>More than half of American Family’s customers, just under 52%, expressed complete satisfaction in regard to status updates they received from the company while their claim was in progress.<br/><br/>After American Family and USAA, there is a four-way tie at No. 3 in this subcategory between State Farm, Farmers, Geico, and Nationwide. Progressive, Travelers, and Allstate tie at No. 7, and AAA is at No. 10.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Most Likely To Be Recommended: USAA and American Family</h3>USAA is the No. 1 insurer in the Most Likely to be Recommended subcategory, finishing ahead of American Family at No. 2. Our survey shows that 63% of USAA policyholders who have not filed a claim are very likely to recommend the company to others looking for car insurance. Among USAA customers who have filed a claim, that number falls to roughly 59%. USAA sells its car insurance products exclusively to members of the military community, so most people in the market for insurance will need to explore policies from other companies.<br/><br/>Just over 40% of policyholders with American Family who have not filed a claim say they are very likely to recommend the insurer to someone looking for a policy, while just over 62% of those who have filed a claim say they’re very likely to offer a recommendation.<br/><br/>Other companies likely to be recommended by their customers include State Farm, Nationwide, and Geico, the companies that are tied at No. 3 in our rating in this subcategory.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Most Likely To Be Renewed: USAA and American Family</h3>Asked whether they would renew their policy with USAA, over 69% of customers who have not filed a claim said they are very likely to do so, according to our survey results. When policyholders who have filed a claim were asked the same question, the numbers didn’t move much: More than 66% described themselves as very likely to renew. Those results helped USAA attain the No. 1 rating in the Most Likely to be Renewed subcategory.<br/><br/>The No. 2 company in this subcategory, American Family, also did well in our survey of consumers. Among those who haven’t filed a claim, roughly 65% were very likely to renew with American Family, and among those who have filed a claim, the number increased, to over 68%.<br/><br/>Nationwide and State Farm are tied at No. 3 in this subcategory. Geico is No. 5.<br/><br/><h3>Best for Customer Loyalty: USAA and American Family</h3>USAA and American Family are tied at No. 1 in the Customer Loyalty subcategory.

Below are the seven major types of car insurance and what they cover.<br/><br/><h3>Collision car insurance</h3>Collision insurance covers you when your vehicle “collides” with something else, such as another vehicle or telephone pole, and the resulting damage from the collision. Depending on your insurance policy and location, <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/collision-car-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759fdba0000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759fdba0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">collision insurance</a> may also cover repairs if you flip your vehicle or are involved in a hit-and-run.<br/><br/><h3>Comprehensive car insurance</h3>This type of insurance protects your vehicle if it is damaged by something other than an accident, such as a natural disaster, fire, theft, or vandalism. <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/comprehensive-car-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759fa650000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759fa650000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Comprehensive insurance</a> coverage is not usually required by state law, but purchasing a policy may be beneficial, especially if you don’t think you could cover the costs of an unexpected repair or possible vehicle replacement.<br/><br/><h3>Full coverage car insurance</h3>Full coverage car insurance is a combination of coverage that protects your vehicle in case of an accident or damages from outside circumstances. Most commonly, full coverage policies include liability, collision, and comprehensive coverage. In addition, <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/full-coverage-car-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-234a-d9fa-a97f-e75a01370000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-234a-d9fa-a97f-e75a01370000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">full coverage</a> could also include coverage required by your particular state, such as uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage, personal injury protection (PIP), or medical payments (MedPay).<br/><br/><h3>Gap insurance</h3>Guaranteed asset protection, or gap insurance, is for drivers who finance or lease their vehicles. If your car is stolen or totaled, <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/gap-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759ffec0000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759ffec0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">gap insurance</a> covers the difference between your car’s value and your outstanding lease or loan balance. It does not cover any other accident-related costs.<br/><br/>For example, let’s say the actual cash value of your vehicle is $20,000, but the balance on your loan is $24,000. Should your car get totaled, gap insurance would cover the remaining $4,000 you’d otherwise pay out-of-pocket.<br/><br/><h3>Liability car insurance</h3>Liability car insurance coverage provides financial protection if you’re legally responsible for an accident that resulted in bodily injury, death, or property damage. It may also apply if someone else is driving your vehicle and is at fault for an accident. Typically, <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/liability-car-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-234a-d9fa-a97f-e75a33090000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-234a-d9fa-a97f-e75a33090000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">liability insurance</a> is required by state law, however, the amount of coverage you need can vary. Note that liability insurance does not cover damages to your own vehicle.<br/><br/><h3>Non-owner car insurance</h3>If you borrow, rent, or share a car with someone else, you may qualify for a non-owner car insurance policy. This type of insurance provides basic liability coverage if you’re driving someone else’s vehicle and are at fault for an accident. It can also cover you if you’ve lost your license and require proof of insurance (SR-22) to reinstate your license. <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/non-owner-car-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759fca90000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-2349-d9fa-a97f-e759fca90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Non-owner car&nbsp; insurance</a> limits usually match each state’s minimum car insurance requirements.<br/><br/><h3>Uninsured motorist car insurance</h3>Uninsured motorist coverage, which is required in 20 U.S. states and Washington D.C., provides financial protection if you’re in an accident with a driver who does not carry liability insurance or leaves the scene of the accident without providing their insurance information. <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/insurance/auto/uninsured-motorist-car-insurance"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017f-234a-d9fa-a97f-e75a30e00000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017f-234a-d9fa-a97f-e75a30e00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Uninsured motorist coverage</a> is often bundled with underinsured motorist coverage, which protects you if you’re in an accident and the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough insurance to fully cover the damage they caused.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-toc-text=""How Much Does Car Insurance Cost? "" data-id=""cost"">How Much Does Car Insurance Cost?&nbsp;</label></h2>According to our most recent analysis, the average annual cost for car insurance is $1,547, or about $127 per month.

If you want to improve your bathroom by changing where your shower or toilet is, you're guaranteeing a higher total cost.<br/><br/>You'll save the most money ""if you can keep the plumbing where it is and the electrical where it is,"" says Paul Dashevsky, co-founder of GreatBuildz, a free service for homeowners connecting them with contractors in Southern California.<br/><h3></h3><h2>Materials vs. Labor</h2><br/>When you're working with professionals on your bathroom renovation, labor is a major part of the bottom line. HomeAdvisor reports that labor costs will account for between 40% and 65% of your total budget.<br/><br/>You may shrink the scope of your remodel project to better fit your budget or to make it a do-it-yourself project. Alternatively, you can take a look at your choice of materials. A prefabricated vanity or shower will cost less than a custom design that has to be put together by specialists. According to home services company Angi, prefab showers made from lightweight plastic can be purchased for as little as $600 with materials and labor, while prefab vanities can be purchased for $100 for the lowest-budget models. <br/><br/>When <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-get-along-with-your-contractor"">finding a contractor</a>, however, the best way to save on the total cost of your remodel is to find a contractor you can trust and to provide the full scope of what you'd like done up front. Jon Grishpul, Dashevsky's co-founder at GreatBuildz, explains that their company's platform focuses on connecting homeowners with the right, properly vetted contractor because they can be hard to find on your own. If you feel you can't trust your contractor, you won't share pertinent information that can save you money on your remodel.<br/><br/>""It's not a hold-your-breath contest,"" says Grishpul, noting that if you have a hard budget you can't go over, let the contractor know. The right contractor may even be able to provide you with alternatives to pricey materials that you didn't know about before.<br/><br/><h2>Toilet</h2><br/>If your bathroom is getting a full renovation overseen by a contractor, <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/bathroom-remodel-costs-to-consider"">replacing the toilet</a> will be a part of the process. But if you're looking to update your bathroom on your own, replacing a toilet requires little skill and can be taken on as a DIY project, says Chip Wade, a master carpenter best known for his roles on HGTV shows like ""Ellen's Design Challenge"" and ""Curb Appeal: The Block.""<br/><br/>To get through the steps without issue, Wade recommends looking at more than one online source or enlisting the help of a friend who has replaced a toilet before.<br/><br/>You can purchase a toilet through any big-box home improvement store like Lowe's or Home Depot. They range in price from less than $100 to more than $300, depending on flush options and bowl shapes that can increase comfort level.<br/><br/><h2>Vanity</h2><br/>Another focal point in any bathroom is the sink and vanity area, and it's also a spot that can look dated quickly as trends go in and out of style. Upgrading from a single to double vanity is a popular option, but that change can easily take your project beyond your budget.<br/><br/>To avoid major plumbing changes that can drive up the cost of your project, explore your options to simply replace what you have with a more modern-looking vanity. Leneiva Head, owner of Welcome Home Realty, a real estate management company in Nashville, Tennessee, recommends heading to the big-box stores to see what vanity options could give your bathroom new life. <br/><br/>""About $300 will get you a really pretty vanity,"" she says.<br/><br/>When working with a pro, if you have a specific vanity in mind already from a store or online, let the contractor know, as it can help you save money. ""A contractor might be thinking you want a custom vanity, but you found one on Wayfair,"" Dashevsky says.<br/><br/>For an even less invasive project, try breathing some new life into the vanity area by replacing the mirror. ""Take that one long mirror that everybody has and get two shorter mirrors,"" Head says. Or frame out your mirror with a pop of color or rustic wood to match your desired look.<br/><br/>The cost to have a professional remove a old vanity is $100 to $400, according to Angi, so you can save a decent amount of money by removing it yourself. <br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686232389379,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-0a01-d221-abce-ba650f2d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686232389379,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-0a01-d221-abce-ba650f2d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000185-f417-d14a-afb7-fcd7f96a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-96e5-d4cb-a3cc-f6e59d070000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : How to Design a Bathroom Wet Room (https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-design-a-bathroom-wet-room)</usn-enhancement><br/><h2>Fixtures</h2><br/>If replacing a tub, shower or bathroom sink is <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/slideshows/home-renovations-under-5000"">outside your budget</a>, you can still make each feature look new again by updating the faucets, knobs and handles.

(https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/building-a-backyard-pond-is-it-worth-it)</usn-enhancement><h2><label  data-id=""bean-bag-toss"">Bean Bag Toss</label></h2>In this classic backyard game, every member of the family can enjoy creating and playing bean bag toss on a warm day. Determine what you’ll be throwing bean bags at – perhaps a set of buckets placed at different distances, or even a large wooden board with holes of various sizes. <br/><br/>Bean bags can be purchased online or at major stores like Target and Walmart, and a set of eight bean bags costs as little as $20. Enlist the help of friends or family members to decorate and set up the game to make it fun for everyone.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""cornhole"">Cornhole</label></h2>Cornhole, a game you’ve probably seen (and played) at barbecues and tailgates, involves two boards and eight bean bags. <br/><br/>Tutorials online offer a few ways to create the cornhole boards, either from plywood and two-by-fours or with a piece of a wooden pallet. Many big-box home improvement stores will cut wood to the right measurements before you leave the store, though you’ll still need a few power tools to complete your cornhole boards. You can even rent a drill and either a hole saw or jigsaw at Lowe’s or Home Depot, where you may also get advice for assembling your boards and making the necessary holes in the surface. Enlist the family to sand, design and paint your cornhole boards for a personalized touch.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""ladder-ball"">Ladder Ball</label></h2>Here's another classic <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/10-home-landscaping-rules-you-should-never-break"">yard</a> game, which involves tossing golf balls attached with rope to try and land them on rungs of a makeshift ladder. A bonus for DIY newbies: Ladder ball can be put together with little effort: <br/><ul><li>You need narrow PVC pipe, as well as a few PVC elbows and tees to connect pieces. Check with your local hardware store to see if it can cut the PVC pipe to the right lengths for you, otherwise you’ll need to rent or borrow a pipe cutter. </li><li>Assemble the pipes into a ladder with three rungs, and be sure to create ""feet"" with the pipes so the ladder can stand on its own. </li><li>Drill a hole in each of the golf balls, then string nylon rope through each, attaching two golf balls to a rope with knots on each end to keep them secure.</li></ul><h2><label  data-id=""tabletop-game-board"">Tabletop Game Board</label></h2>Not every backyard game requires running around. But when it comes to board games, you may find yourself struggling to find a flat surface to play a tabletop game in your <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/slideshows/9-outdoor-living-renovations-to-splurge-on-this-summer/"">outdoor living space</a>. A simple piece of plywood and some paint can give you a larger surface on which to play board games. <br/><br/>Recreate your favorite game boards on either side of the plywood (aim to avoid any games that require cards or play money that can blow away in the wind). A tic-tac-toe board and either a chess or checkers board are popular options that make it easy for people of any age to take part in the setup and play time.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""giant-jenga"">Giant Jenga</label></h2>Few people will be able to resist a game of giant Jenga when they see it in a backyard or outdoor space. It’s simple to make your own: <br/><ul><li>Have two-by-fours cut into 54 even pieces – each 10.5 inches long. You can cut the wood yourself with a saw at home or commission a local home improvement store. </li><li>Prevent splinters by sanding each newly cut Jenga piece, and you can opt to stain or paint the wood for looks and longevity. </li><li>Set up your game on a flat surface in your backyard – a <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/backyard-patio-ideas"">patio</a> or large table will work well.</li></ul><h2><label  data-id=""lawn-scrabble"">Lawn Scrabble-style game</label></h2>If you have the time, patience and enough open space in your yard, a DIY game of giant Scrabble can be an Instagram-worthy way to spend time in your yard. You’ll need 100 letter tiles total, which can be cut from plywood. <br/><br/>Choose the size of tile you’ll enjoy most – some online tutorials recommend 6 inches on each side, while others recommend 10 or 12 inches. Replicate the tiles in a Scrabble set to get the right number of each letter and associated points, and paint those details on each tile. You can go the extra mile and create the board game on a canvas sheet, or forgo double- and triple-word scores to let the game take place directly on your lawn.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686157329669,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-0a01-d221-abce-ba650f2d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686157329669,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-0a01-d221-abce-ba650f2d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000187-c80f-d3dc-a5d7-d84f47170000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-96ce-dd0f-abf8-fedfc7c30000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : How to Plant a Pollinator Garden (https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-plant-a-pollinator-garden)</usn-enhancement><h2><label  data-id=""lawn-twister"">Lawn Twister</label></h2>Even a small patch of grass can be transformed into a living Twister mat by spray-painting the classic circles directly on the grass (avoid a permanent Twister board game on your lawn by using spray chalk). <br/><br/>An individual bottle of spray chalk comes as cheap as $5, and companies like Testors and Boley sell multicolor packs on Amazon or at Walmart starting around $15. Just be sure you don’t accidentally buy chalkboard spray paint or spray paint with a chalked finish, as those are permanent paints designed to go on furniture.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""balloon-darts"">Balloon Darts</label></h2>Make your backyard feel more like a carnival by creating your own balloon darts game, which can be easily made with a pack of balloons and a cork board or piece of plywood. Attach the tied-off ends of inflated balloons with thumb tacks or staples, and set up the board in the yard with a solid surface behind it. <br/><br/>Darts sets come cheap, starting around $15 at Target, though you can always grab the old dart board you may have somewhere in your basement. Just be sure to collect all darts after playing to avoid injury to bare feet in the yard later.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""diy-obstacle-course"">DIY Obstacle Course</label></h2>If your kids like to run around, set up an obstacle course in your yard. Cater each obstacle to your kid’s age and your DIY abilities, whether that means building a mini A-frame climbing wall or laying down paving stones for your kids to jump to. <br/><br/>An obstacle course is a perfect opportunity to use up leftover wood and supplies from any previous home improvement DIY projects. Consider obstacles like a two-by-two wood plank balance beam, wood or PVC pipe hurdles to jump over or duck under and a wood pallet platform.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""yard-bowling"">Yard Bowling</label></h2>Transform a trip to the bowling alley into an afternoon <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/slideshows/9-items-to-never-leave-outside-your-house"">backyard</a> activity by reusing items in your recycling bin to create an outdoor bowling lane. Decorate 10 empty plastic bottles to look like bowling pins, weight them with dirt, sand or gravel at the bottom, and send a ball their way. If you have enough plastic bottles, you can set up two games next to each other to keep the action going, creating lane lines with spray chalk.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""slip-and-slide"">Slip and Slide</label></h2>Upgrade your outdoor cooldown routine from running through the sprinkler by creating a DIY version of the Slip 'N Slide.<br/><ul><li>Lay out a large tarp or heavy-duty plastic sheet, and turn on the hose, wetting the entire surface. </li><li>Dish soap or baby soap will help make the surface extra slippery. </li><li>Continue to wet the surface with the hose or sprinkler while in use to avoid any areas drying out and creating too much friction. </li><li>You can find yourself slipping and sliding whether your yard has a hill or is a flat surface, but this activity is best done in a large yard with relatively soft ground to avoid injury.</li></ul><h2><label  data-id=""squirt-gun-races"">Squirt Gun Races</label></h2>Keep cool with more <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/steps-to-an-affordable-diy-above-groundpool"">water activities</a> by creating your own squirt gun race.<br/><ul><li>Punch two small holes in the side of a disposable cup, and run a string through it so the cup moves easily along the string. </li><li>Tie each end of the string to trees, fence posts or other sturdy items in your yard. </li><li>Repeat with at least one more cup and string, or more to allow more people to play at once. </li><li>Each player gets a water gun and squirts water into the inside of the cup, moving it along the string toward the opposite end.

You can opt to build a garden bed frame out of wood directly on the ground or add wooden legs to elevate it so the garden bed can be moved easily. Add soil to the box you’ve built and plant seeds of herbs, vegetables or flowers that appeal to you. Garden beds are easy to right-size to your yard, so this activity can be done in a small space or a big one, and every member of the family can have their own garden bed to tend to.<br/><h2><label  data-id=""shaded-activity-spot"">Shaded Activity Spot</label></h2>Catching some rays can feel great, but the sunburn afterward will not. Too much time spent in the sun and heat can damage more than just your skin, so it’s a good idea to set up a place in your yard that allows you to cool down and relax without going inside. If you don’t already have a shaded area under a canopy or pergola, you can create a simple one with a canvas sheet held up by wooden posts buried in planters at each corner. Add to the shade by attaching canvas sheets to one or two sides.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686757058693,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-19fb-d7c2-a1bf-1ffb5b7e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686757058693,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-19fb-d7c2-a1bf-1ffb5b7e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000188-1cce-d150-afcc-dddecbba0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;promoText&quot;:&quot;RELATED CONTENT&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-ba8e-decf-a5cb-beee29480000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;8eebe97b-8898-32af-87c4-e35cec8ee4bd&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-ba8e-dbe5-a1d8-ffcf01890000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Article : How to Build a Treehouse (230601realestate.howtobuildatreehouse) (3 PV)</usn-enhancement>","real estate, homeownership, outdoor living, home improvements, DIY, family, Summer",,Fri Jun 16 09:50:12 EDT 2023,Devon Thorsby
Article,Supreme Court Ethics Questions Reach Far Beyond Clarence Thomas (230616report.scotus) (316 PV),Fri Jun 16 09:24:24 EDT 2023,Fri Jun 16 09:24:24 EDT 2023,"Former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the staunch originalist and one of the most praised conservative members of all time, was also one of the high court’s most frequent travelers, globe-trotting on trips paid for by private sponsors for three decades and ringing ethics alarms along the way.<br/><br/>In fact, Scalia took 258 subsidized trips in the decade spanning 2004 to 2014, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, including at least 23 privately funded trips in 2014 alone to places like Hawaii, Ireland and Switzerland, where he would also give speeches, participate in court events or teach classes.<br/><br/>When he died unexpectedly in 2016, he was staying, all expenses paid, at a hunting lodge in Texas owned by a businessman whose company had a matter before the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>In his most high-profile ethics transgression, Scalia refused to recuse himself from a case in 2004 involving Vice President Dick Cheney, with whom he had recently hunted and dined – a trip that occurred three weeks after the court agreed to hear a case over whether the White House was required turn over documents relating to an energy task force Cheney headed in 2001.<br/><br/>At the time, Cheney was fighting a federal court's order that he release internal files from the energy task force he headed for the Bush administration – an order that stemmed from a lawsuit that alleged he made improper contacts with energy industry lobbyists when developing government policy.<br/><br/>Cheney and Scalia flew together on Air Force Two to Louisiana, where the vice president stayed for two days on the hunting trip and the justice stayed for four. Prior to that, the pair also dined with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the Eastern Shore of Maryland when the Supreme Court was considering Cheney's appeal.<br/><br/>In defending himself, Scalia wrote in a <a  href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-475.ZA.html""><u>21-page defense</u></a> that he did not believe his impartiality could be reasonably questioned.<br/><br/>""If it is reasonable to think that a Supreme Court Justice can be bought so cheap, the Nation is in deeper trouble than I had imagined,"" he wrote. ""Why would that result follow from my being in a sizable group of persons, in a hunting camp with the vice president, where I never hunted with him in the same blind or had other opportunity for private conversation?""<br/><br/>He also dismissed accusations that a friendship alone meets the standard for recusal – an argument that Justice Clarence Thomas has been making with vigor in recent weeks as revelations of his own ethics improprieties mount.<br/><br/>""The only possibility [for recusal] is that it would suggest I am a friend of his,” Scalia wrote. “But while friendship is a ground for recusal of a Justice, where the personal fortune or the personal freedom is at issue, it has traditionally not been a ground for recusal where official action is at issue, no matter how important the official action was.""<br/><br/>Of course, Scalia was hardly the first Supreme Court justice whose moral compass was called into question – and Thomas’ won’t be the last.<br/><br/>Lapses in judgment by justices of the Supreme Court go as far back as the founding fathers: President John Quincy Adams hosted dinner parties attended by justices, Justice Harlan Stone exercised with members of the Hoover administration and Justice William Douglas regularly attended President Franklin Roosevelt’s poker parties, as did Chief Justice Frederick Vinson with President Harry Truman.<br/><br/>In 1969, Justice Abe Fortas became the first and only justice to resign after it was revealed that he took a secret retainer – $20,000 a year for life – from a Wall Street financier who was subsequently imprisoned for securities violations, as well as for his close relationship with then-President Lyndon Johnson, who appointed him.<br/><br/>But fast forward to the current court and the frequency and depth of transgressions seems to have reached a crescendo.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that the wife of Chief Justice John Roberts <a  href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/31/us/john-roberts-jane-sullivan-roberts.html""><u>made more than $10 million</u></a> in commissions in her role as a headhunter for elite law firms, including some that had cases before the Supreme Court.<br/><br/><a  href=""https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow""><u>ProPublica reported</u></a> that for more than two decades Justice Clarence Thomas has been treated to lavish vacations by billionaire and Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, including on his yacht, private jet and exclusive resorts. He bought the house where Thomas’ mother lives and provided most of the budget for a conservative political organization founded by Thomas’ wife, Ginny. Crow also covered the tab of the private school tuition for Thomas’ grand-nephew, who the justice raised since the boy was 6 years old.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, <a  href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/25/neil-gorsuch-colorado-property-sale-00093579""><u>Politico reported</u></a> that nine days after Justice Neil Gorsuch was confirmed, he sold a 40-acre property that he co-owned and was long on the market to Brian Duffy, the chief executive of Greenberg Traurig, one of the nation’s biggest law firms, who has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the court.<br/><br/>Republicans have slammed the reports – and subsequent calls for ethics reforms – as a partisan witch hunt, but the ethics transgressions are far from one-sided.<br/><br/>Former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg failed to disqualify herself from more than 20 cases involving companies that her husband held stock in through an IRA account, including Exxon, General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AT&amp;T, among others.<br/><br/>In 2015, former Justice Stephen Breyer failed to recuse himself from a high-profile energy case in which his wife owned more than $30,000 in stock in a company that was a party to the case.<br/><br/>More recently, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the high court’s most senior liberal, failed to recuse herself from three cases involving Penguin Random House, the publishing giant that includes the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, which has paid Sotomayor more than $3 million in book advances since 2010. Sotomayor joined the court in 2009.<br/><br/>“Thomas’s transgressions are far worse than any other justice, but at the same time, every justice has taken trips that were a little sketchy or taken gifts that they probably shouldn't have or forgotten to report things on their disclosures,” says Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a nonpartisan nonprofit watchdog group that advocates for non-ideological changes to make the federal courts, and primarily the U.S. Supreme Court, more open and more accountable.<br/><br/>According to <a  href=""https://fixthecourt.com/2023/04/justices-financial-disclosure-omissions-this-will-be-updated-as-additional-info-becomes-available/""><u>research compiled by Fix the Court</u></a>, all nine of the sitting justices are culpable of various ethical oversights, from leaving assets off their annual financial disclosure reports to speaking at partisan fundraisers to ruling on cases despite credible conflicts of interest. None, however, has committed an offense that rises to the level of removal.<br/><br/>“Everyone has skin in the game,” Roth says.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686882202397,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014a-d05d-daec-a97a-dd7f61230000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686882202397,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000014a-d05d-daec-a97a-dd7f61230000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-a988-d1f7-a379-bbdda5800002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff7000b&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-c203-db1e-abbe-cabb53b00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Cartoon Gallery : Editorial Cartoons on Politics (210526cartoons.politics) (6,187 PV)</usn-enhancement>Even Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, the newest liberal justice whose judicial resume stood out during her confirmation process for being ethically stringent – going beyond what’s asked of federal judges when it comes to recusals, for example – left out disclosures as a lower court judge about trips to Berkeley Law and the Aspen Institute, a teaching position at George Washington University, four board positions and information on her daughters’ college fund.<br/><br/>This year’s <a  href=""https://www.scotusblog.com/justices-financial-disclosures/""><u>disclosure reports</u></a>, released earlier this month and reviewed by U.S. News, are more detailed than years’ past, perhaps a sign the justices are taking their reporting duties more seriously, but also are in part to revised ethics rules published in March, which require, at least in some cases concerning free trips and gifts, fuller explanations.<br/><br/>Justice Roberts, for example, provide more context when reporting his wife’s income.<br/><br/>Yet Justice Jackson was the only justice to report gifts, which included a flower arrangement from Oprah Winfrey worth $1,200 and a designer outfit she wore in photos for a profile in Vogue magazine, estimated to cost $6,580.<br/><br/>Justices Thomas and Alito asked for – and were granted – 90-day extensions.<br/><br/>Legal and judicial ethics experts agree that the court is at a watershed moment, standing on the precipice of public trust.<br/><br/>“I think we are looking at this against the backdrop of an important moment in judicial politics, where we've just seen a major pivot in the composition of the Supreme Court,” says Charles Geyh, law professor at Indiana University. “It's taking a turn to the right that the Republican Party has really been agitating for since the Reagan administration. They have succeeded in achieving that. It's making Democrats furious and they are watching the court like a hawk.”<br/><br/>“You have McConnell saying things like, ‘It’s a witch hunt,’ but really it is a watershed moment,” he says. “It means you don’t get free passes anymore. You have to watch your behavior.”<br/><br/>Geyh says that in conversations with federal court judges, the ethics transgressions unearthed about Justice Thomas elicit eye rolls.<br/><br/>“It’s just worse than careless,” he says. “I wouldn't even think of doing some of these things. The idea that you would have a friend that met you once you had been on the Supreme Court paying for your grand-nephew’s education – it's just not what a judge acculturated to a code would do.”<br/><br/>The signs were there.<br/><br/>In 2014, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell – a one-time GOP presidential prospect – was found guilty of 11 felony public corruption counts by a federal judge in a case with similarities to Thomas’ situation. It involved a friendship with a wealthy businessman who plied McDonnell and his family with gifts and trips and even hosted the governor’s daughter’s wedding at his grand estate. McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison and the verdict was upheld by a federal appeals court. Yet the justices intervened almost immediately, issuing an order delaying the sentence pending a review. McDonnell’s conviction was vacated unanimously by the high court in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts that narrowed the definition of public corruption while calling the case itself “distasteful.”<br/><br/>The justices have <a  href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/09/supreme-court-ethics-code/""><u>reportedly</u></a> been internally debating how to reform their code of ethics for the last four years but have failed to reach consensus and have not committed to a timeline.<br/><br/>“From where I sit, there is no earthly good reason for them not to just adopt a code of ethics on their own,” Geyh says. “For someone like Sen. Mitch McConnell to say, ‘Well they haven't done enough wrong to justify the need for a code’ – on the one hand you can say, ‘Well yeah, they kind of have.’ But on the other hand you can say, you know that saying, you don’t need a code unless you’ve misbehaved, is kind of like saying you don't need a Bible unless you've sinned.”<br/><br/>“It is a good book, there is a value in subscribing to its principles, regardless of whether you've been behaving badly,” he says. “It is intended to be a group of rules that says here's what a good judge does. Abide by them, internalize them, revisit them, revise them, think about them. And unless you have that document in front of you, you can’t do that.”<br/><br/>Overall, the perception of the court has taken a hit. A Gallup poll taken last year showed that just 25% of the public has faith in the Supreme Court – a new low, and down from 31% in 2021 in the wake of increasing perceptions of politicization and a widely unpopular ruling overturning the Roe v. Wade precedent that guaranteed abortion access. The ethical controversies have done little to restore trust.<br/><br/>“None of the justices should be accepting outside payments,” Roth says. “Forget for a second the yachts and the planes, none of these justices should be flouting the disclosure rules but we know that many of them, if not all of them, are failing to be fully transparent when filing them every year.”<br/><br/>“There is a larger trend progressing, which is exactly a result of how much power the court has amassed in the last two decades,” he says. “In terms of changing the institution, we really need to get the entire body to take ethics more seriously and their responsibility regarding ethics more seriously.”<br/><br/>With the Supreme Court seemingly paralyzed in their ability to willingly adopt a code of ethics, some in Congress are attempting to do it for them.<br/><br/>Democrats in both chambers have called for next year’s funding for the Supreme Court to be conditioned on the creation of an ethics code for the justices, including requiring them to adopt more transparent processes for recusals and for investigating ethics allegations lodged against the justices. And in a rare bipartisan effort, independent Sen. Angus King of Maine and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska introduced a bill that would force the Supreme Court to establish an ethics code and also require the court to appoint an official to examine potential conflicts and public complaints.<br/><br/>But such legislation – even if it garners bipartisan support in the Senate – would be difficult to pass through the Republican-controlled House at a time when the court’s conservative majority is set to move on a slate of issues important to their voting base. And the justices have so far not been willing to participate.<br/><br/>Chief Justice John Roberts declined to make himself or any other justice available to testify at a Senate hearing last month, citing “separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence.”<br/><br/>Partisan posturing has elevated in recent weeks.<br/><br/>Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon requested a complete accounting of Harlan Crow’s gifts to Justice Thomas, but the billionaire declined to answer a series of questions about the financial arrangements the two had for the past two decades.<br/><br/>In response to Wyden’s pledge to use “any of the tools at [the committee’s] disposal” to compel answers from Crow, Utah’s Republican Sen. Mike Lee blasted Democrats for blowing the gifts out of proportion.<br/><br/>“We reject this manufactured ethics crisis at the Supreme Court as a ploy to further Democrats’ efforts to undermine public confidence and change the makeup of the court,” Lee wrote in the <a  href=""https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee/status/1655713754284277765/photo/1""><u>letter</u></a> also signed by 13 of his Republican colleagues. “It is clear to us that Democrats are simply enraged that the court is no longer acting as a super legislature to implement progressive policies. This anger has now manifested itself in baseless ethics smears toward the justices.”<br/><br/>Senate Democrats furthered their pressure campaign on the justices this week, holding a hearing to determine what type of tools they have to enforce a code of ethics on the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>“There are plenty of ways the court could fix its ethics problems. I’ve offered solutions more times than I can count,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee subcommittee that deals with federal courts and oversight. “But still we wait for the court to do something – anything – to show that it takes its ethics seriously.”<br/><br/>Among other things, Whitehouse has introduced two bills aimed at increasing ethics standards at the court – one that would establish 18-year term limits on the justices and another aimed at exposing special interest spending as a way to influence government entities by requiring groups that lay out money on ads supporting or opposing judicial nominees to disclose their donors.<br/><br/>“If the Supreme Court isn't going to do anything to restore the public’s trust then it's up to us in Congress,” Whitehouse said.<br/><br/>What worries some constitutional law and ethics experts, including Geyh, is potential backlash from the justices should Congress attempt to exert authority through legislation over a body that has never had to report to anyone.<br/><br/>“This is a push or shove moment,” Geyh says.<br/><br/>“If the court doesn't get off its high horse and adopt a code for itself – which I think it just should – then the business of forcing it to do so by legislation could result in the court hearing a case and declaring that unconstitutional, which would just create a real – if not a constitutional crisis, something close to it,” he says. “Where it’s, ‘You're not the boss of me, we can be as unethical as we want to be, go away.’ And that is one hell of a message if you’re struggling to preserve your legitimacy.”","Supreme Court, Thomas, Clarence, ethics",,Fri Jun 16 05:08:00 EDT 2023,Lauren Camera

The Emancipation Proclamation did not end slavery throughout the U.S., but in December 1865, the ratification of the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the country.<br/><br/><h2>What does Juneteenth celebrate?</h2>Celebrations for Juneteenth began in 1866. Some people held parties, parades, prayer gatherings or cookouts. In 1980, Juneteenth first became a state holiday in Texas, and over time, other states and Washington, D.C., slowly began to recognize the date as a holiday too.<br/><br/>The interest in Juneteenth becoming a national holiday gained momentum following the nationwide popularity of the Black Lives Matter movement. After a quick debate in Congress, Juneteenth was designated the newest federal holiday on June 17, 2021. It's the first federal holiday to be established since 1983, when Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday was formally declared a holiday.<br/><br/>Whether it's a music festival, a parade, a cookout or a march, there are plenty of ways to honor Juneteenth across the country. U.S. News compiled a list of the top destinations to celebrate Juneteenth in 2023.<br/><br/><h2>Fort Worth, Texas</h2><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1685720620153,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1685720620153,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-5ea4-d466-a5f7-dfb5fa860001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60014&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;linkList&quot;:[],&quot;removeLink&quot;:false,&quot;disableCaptionCredit&quot;:false,&quot;disableHorizontalRule&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-5e8f-db3d-abad-7f9f5f880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;e8d9e3a6-ce89-3a63-a6be-0e7419c370bb&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-5e8f-db3d-abad-7f9f3bc40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Image : 220613travel.juneteenth_Submitted (Centered)</usn-enhancement>The campaign to recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday began in <a  href=""https://travel.usnews.com/Dallas-Fort_Worth_TX/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://travel.usnews.com/Dallas-Fort_Worth_TX/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Fort Worth</a> thanks to activist Opal Lee. As a child, Lee witnessed a group of 500 white supremacists vandalize and burn her family's home to the ground. This pivotal moment led her to a life of teaching and activism. In 2016, at age 89, she began a walking campaign starting in her hometown of Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., in hopes of getting Juneteenth recognized as a federal holiday.<br/><br/>Lee walked 2.5 miles a day, symbolizing the years it took for Black Texans to be free from slavery after Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. While her initial effort failed, she relaunched the campaign in 2019 but had to suspend her efforts once COVID-19 began to spread. She was present when President Joe Biden signed the legislation in 2021 making Juneteenth a federal holiday.<br/><br/>Lee's hometown, Fort Worth, holds several events during the month of June. Travelers can participate in Opal's Walk for Freedom for a fee to commemorate her historic walk on June 19. Participants and spectators can admire floats and vehicles decorated in their Juneteenth best as they make their way down the 2.5-mile route.<br/><br/>Visit the Amon Carter Museum of American Art to see its new exhibit called ""Emancipation: The Unfinished Project of Liberation."" The exhibition features artwork depicting freedom for Black Americans and the legacy of the Civil War in 2023.

While slavery did not end in Maryland until 1864, Baltimore was home to the largest free Black community in a U.S. city during the 1860s.<br/><br/>Thanks to its large Black population, the city became a hot spot for jazz music; many notable jazz musicians, including Billie Holiday, Eubie Blake and Chick Webb, lived or were born in Baltimore. Along Pennsylvania Avenue, the Royal Theater was once a popular venue that became part of the infamous Chitlin' Circuit: spaces that catered to Black audiences and performers.<br/><br/>Considering the city's ties to so many legendary musicians, it's no surprise that many of the Juneteenth events happening around town are music-centric.<br/><br/>The 46th annual AFRAM festival is a two-day event starting on June 17. During the Juneteenth weekend, enjoy live music from artists like The Isley Brothers and Ty Dolla $ign on top of fashion and food at Druid Hill Park.<br/><br/>You'll find live jazz at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum's Jazz on the Rails concert series. The Juneteenth celebration will also pay homage to past, present and future railroad employees and to the industry. The Baltimore Museum of Art will offer free admission on June 18 so visitors can see the exhibit ""The Culture: Hip Hop and Contemporary Art in the 21st Century,"" which captures the influence of hip-hop on art as the music genre celebrates 50 years.<br/><br/>Outside of the many Juneteenth music festivities, the Walters Art Museum will host a ""Juneteenth: Honoring Food, Traditions, and Histories"" talk on June 15. The Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture will host a daylong Juneteenth celebration on June 19.

Despite the huge slave-trading firm located in the city, Alexandria had several free Black residents. The first free Black community called ""The Bottoms"" was located in the southwestern part of the city, and by 1810 a new neighborhood known as Hayti was created in the eastern portion of the city. The free Black population continued to grow in Alexandria until 1846, when the city retroceded from D.C. to rejoin the state of Virginia.<br/><br/>Alexandria has plenty for travelers to do during Juneteenth.<br/><br/>Take a tour of the city on the ""Black History in Alexandria"" Bus Tour hosted by the Manumission Tour Company. The two-hour guided tour takes visitors on a journey through the area to see historical sites such as the Freedom House Museum and the Alfred Street Baptist Church. The company also hosts several other tours around Alexandria focused on Black history as well.<br/><br/>The Carlyle House, named for businessman John Carlyle who helped found the city, will host its annual Juneteenth celebration collaborating with The Athenaeum, a local arts organization, on June 17. Attendees will be able to learn more about Juneteenth with hands-on activities and poetry readings.<br/><br/>The Washington Revels Jubilee Voices' Juneteenth concert is slated for June 19 at Market Square. Hear songs exploring the triumphs and tribulations of the Black community. You can also visit the Alexandria Black History Museum, which reopened in March 2023 after a three-year hiatus. The exhibit ""Preserving Their Names: The Black Lives Remembered Collection"" has more than 300 images and artifacts. Or, stop by the Freedom House Museum, which pays homage to enslaved and free Black people who lived in or were trafficked through the city.<br/><br/>Check out the <a  href=""https://visitalexandria.com/things-to-do/historic-attractions-and-museums/african-american/juneteenth/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://visitalexandria.com/things-to-do/historic-attractions-and-museums/african-american/juneteenth/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Visit Alexandria website</a> for more information.<br/><br/><h2>Philadelphia</h2><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1685720897583,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1685720897583,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-5ed6-d466-a5f7-dfd79c640001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60014&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;linkList&quot;:[],&quot;removeLink&quot;:false,&quot;disableCaptionCredit&quot;:false,&quot;disableHorizontalRule&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-5ed7-db3d-abad-7fdf0ce70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;e8d9e3a6-ce89-3a63-a6be-0e7419c370bb&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-5ed6-db3d-abad-7fdef0630000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Image : 220613travel.Juneteenth_Editorial (Centered)</usn-enhancement>Philadelphia is famously the home of the <a  href=""https://travel.usnews.com/Philadelphia_PA/Things_To_Do/Liberty_Bell_Center_52507/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://travel.usnews.com/Philadelphia_PA/Things_To_Do/Liberty_Bell_Center_52507/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Liberty Bell</a> and <a  href=""https://travel.usnews.com/Philadelphia_PA/Things_To_Do/Independence_Hall_41748/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://travel.usnews.com/Philadelphia_PA/Things_To_Do/Independence_Hall_41748/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Independence Hall</a>, where the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were drafted and signed, but the city also played an important role in Black history.

Myers' activism helped encourage 43 states and Washington, D.C., to create their own Juneteenth celebrations, but it would be over two decades before Juneteenth became a federal holiday.<br/><br/>The city of <a  href=""https://travel.usnews.com/Milwaukee_WI/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://travel.usnews.com/Milwaukee_WI/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Milwaukee</a>'s Juneteenth event is considered one of the oldest celebrations in the country.

""(But) it's not the way it is. There's a lot we (chiropractors) can do to help with discomfort during pregnancy and make pregnancy enjoyable and comfortable."" <br/><br/>When the woman reached her third trimester, a midwife suggested <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2016-11-09/the-pros-and-cons-of-seeing-a-chiropractor"">chiropractic treatment</a> –&nbsp;and referred her to Brocker.

This allowed the joint to get stuck, which caused the woman pain during movement. <br/><br/>Brocker treated her three times over two weeks, providing simple adjustments as she would with most patients.

During an initial visit, a chiropractor typically takes a thorough health history and does a physical exam, paying attention to anything that may be a contraindication to chiropractic care, like a fractured bone or joint dislocation. <br/><br/>The chiropractor can then employ an array of adjustments. For example, they can use their hands to apply controlled and rapid force – pressure, more specifically – to a restricted joint. This allows the joint to move in a normal manner and reduces inflammation and pain, Brocker explains. <br/><h2>Chiropractic Care During Pregnancy</h2>Concerned about the dangers of chiropractic care during pregnancy? Modifications to the applied force with special populations – like pregnant women – help ensure the adjustment is ""comfortable, safe and effective,"" Brocker says. <br/><br/>If you're pregnant, experiencing discomfort and considering seeking chiropractic treatment, experts recommend these strategies:<br/><span class=""rte rte-comment""          data-user-id=""00000183-79d6-dbd7-a5e7-fbd7e29a0000""          data-user-label=""Caroline J.

This access makes it possible to do a lot of things on a bank holiday, such as deposit a check with your smartphone. However, the check likely won't be processed until the next business day.<br/><br/>You will also be able to open up a bank account online during a bank holiday, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts or certificates of deposit.<br/><br/>If you need to send money to someone on a bank holiday, consider using a payment app, such as Venmo or PayPal, which allows you to send and receive money from people. <br/><br/><h2>Paying a Bill on a Bank Holiday</h2>If you have an automated bill payment that falls on a Federal Reserve holiday, the payment won't process until the next business day, which can lead to extra fees if you miss the due date. All withdrawals will also be suspended on bank holidays. Make sure you plan ahead for bills that fall on these holidays so your payments post in time. <br/><br/><h2>Using an ATM on a Federal Bank Holiday </h2>Although bank branches will be closed on a holiday, the ATMs will not. You will be able to check your account balance and make cash withdrawals. As a plus, some banks offer ATMs that are open 24 hours. <br/><br/><usn-enhancement>Related Link Enhancement : Best Checking Accounts.

It’s likely that a spring mattress will have a bounciness that keeps you on top of it, rather than a sinking-in feeling that’s common on foam beds. While some prefer this feeling, others might be more comfortable on a mattress that contours more deeply to the body. Spring mattresses can often provide greater support around the edges to prevent compressing under your weight when you sit or sleep on the sides of your bed.<br/><br/>Sleeper types who might feel best on a spring bed include those who typically prefer a firmer support level, like stomach sleepers and <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/mattress/best-mattress-for-heavy-people"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017c-ebe3-dd7c-a77e-ffe75e540000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017c-ebe3-dd7c-a77e-ffe75e540000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">heavier individuals</a>.

Our sleep expert, a petite side sleeper, felt it was too firm for her. Similar sleepers may want to opt for the additional cushioning of memory foam.<br/><br/>However, unlike older spring beds, most modern spring mattresses contain an upper comfort layer made from a cushioning material like foam or a pillow top to provide pressure relief above the coils. These mattresses also allow for better airflow than foam, which may be preferable to <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/mattress/best-cooling-mattress"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""00000175-6f64-d906-ab7d-efed2c250000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000175-6f64-d906-ab7d-efed2c250000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">hot sleepers</a>.<br/><br/>Given the bouncy feel, spring beds might disrupt sleep for anyone who is easily awoken by motion on the mattress from a partner, pets, or kids. For example, when testing the innerspring Saatva Classic in our lab, our sleep expert would roll toward other testers when they sat down on the bed or climbed off of it. Individually wrapped coils aim to reduce motion moving across the mattress, but sleepers especially sensitive to motion might sleep best on a foam mattress that excels in absorbing movement.<br/><br/><br/><h2><label  data-toc-text=""How To Buy a Spring Mattress"" data-id=""how-to-buy"">How To Buy a Spring Mattress</label></h2>Investing in a new mattress requires research, patience, and testing.

Here are some points to keep in mind when shopping for an innerspring mattress either in the store or online.<br/><br/><b>1. Know the mattress’s coil system.</b> An innerspring mattress has two numbers associated with the coil system: a coil gauge and a coil count.<br/><ul><li>Coil Gauge: Typically between 13 and 18, this indicates how thick the coil is, with lower numbers typically meaning a stronger coil.&nbsp;</li><li>Coil Count: This can indicate quality, though that isn’t always the case. If the coils are flimsy and not durable, for example, a large coil count won’t make up for poor quality.</li></ul>Individually wrapped pocketed coils are especially sought after since these move independently of one another and can provide targeted support. This also improves motion isolation.<br/><br/><b>2. See if the mattress has an at-home sleep trial. </b>Whether buying online or from a store, nothing compares to sleeping on a mattress. Most companies offer an at-home sleep trial so you can make sure you feel comfortable and well supported on your new bed. A 120-night sleep trial is average, according to our analysis of more than 200 mattresses, but some manufacturers offer a full 365 days.<br/><br/><b>3. Look into a company’s shipping and setup policies. </b>It’s worth looking into the company’s shipping policy and prices to see if you’ll be incurring any extra costs or long waits. Similarly, check to see if the mattress will be delivered to your doorstep or if it comes with in-room setup.<br/><br/><b>4. Research a company’s return policy and warranty.</b> Always check on the company’s return policy, especially if you’re not sure which firmness level you prefer. Also, read the warranty’s fine print to make sure you’re covered if the mattress has any manufacturing defects.<br/><br/><b>5. Make sure you select the right foundation. </b>When setting up your new mattress at home, it’s important to provide the right foundation so the bed can best support you. Conveniently, innerspring mattresses work with several types of bed foundations. Always check your mattress manufacturer's recommendations about what foundations are appropriate for your mattress. This will help ensure your mattress has the longest lifespan possible and that you don’t void the warranty. Here are some foundations that are typically recommended for innerspring mattresses:<br/><ul><li>Adjustable bases</li><li><a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/mattress/do-you-need-box-spring"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""0000017e-ff5f-da45-a97f-ffdf4f860007"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-ff5f-da45-a97f-ffdf4f860007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Box springs</a></li><li><a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/what-is-platform-bed"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""00000184-c4ae-d53a-a394-e7ef054b0009"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-c4ae-d53a-a394-e7ef054b0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Platform beds</a></li></ul><br/><h2><label  data-toc-text=""FAQ"" data-id=""faq"">FAQ</label></h2><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1685631567839,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4d7e-dfad-a9b9-6dfe5dc70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1685631567839,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4d7e-dfad-a9b9-6dfe5dc70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-7cc6-de50-a7bf-fef766d90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000177-6d69-d74f-ad7f-edffae400002&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-7cc7-de50-a7bf-fef7b2fb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">FAQ Module : Mattresses -

When it comes to firmness level, choices include Plush Soft (a 3 out of 10 on the firmness scale), Luxury Firm (5 to 7, or medium to medium-firm), and Firm (8). Saatva mentions the most popular is the Luxury Firm version, and it’s worth noting the firmness and height don’t alter the mattress price, which is <output data-point=\&quot;{&amp;quot;fieldName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;basePrice&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;56a34d48-9eee-3bb6-a54b-3dfff066d445&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;object&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_ref&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0000016b-8a95-d6ac-ab6f-9bb721010000&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0000016b-6bbc-d278-ad6b-ebbd124a0000&amp;quot;}}\&quot;>$1,995</output> for a queen size.<br/><br/>When we evaluated the Saatva Classic in Luxury Firm in our labs, it was fairly bouncy, possibly because innersprings tend to make a mattress more responsive. Our sleep expert and testers could feel every movement on the mattress when changing positions or getting in and out of bed.<br/><br/>When it comes to cooling, the Saatva Classic is made with a 3-inch, built-in cotton pillow top that’s hypoallergenic and aims to provide a breathable sleeping surface. Below this is a dual layer of coils for support and greater airflow through the mattress, making it less likely to trap hot air.<br/><br/>When we tried out the Saatva Classic, we didn’t notice an especially cooling feeling while laying on the mattress, but we didn’t notice any heat retention either. One plus was that when two testers lay on the mattress, neither could feel the body heat of the other person, which could make this mattress a good bet for couples.<br/><br/>Saatva offers a 365-night sleep trial as well as free shipping and in-home setup, but keep in mind that returns come with a $99 processing fee.&quot;,&quot;cardHeader&quot;:&quot;<b>Saatva Classic</b>&quot;,&quot;showModal&quot;:false,&quot;hideProsCons&quot;:false,&quot;pros&quot;:[],&quot;cons&quot;:[],&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8fc8-d5f0-adba-effa54f00000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;cfe2737a-4291-336f-a276-9721d24122f0&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8fc8-d5f0-adba-effa31000000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Mattress : Saatva Classic</usn-enhancement><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1651679757239,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-b0ea-d8ec-af7a-f0ebdc040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1651679757239,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017a-b0ea-d8ec-af7a-f0ebdc040000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017b-2b91-d9f6-abfb-ebd5ee210000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60014&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;removeLink&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8fc9-d5f0-adba-effb057c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;e8d9e3a6-ce89-3a63-a6be-0e7419c370bb&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000180-8fc8-d5f0-adba-effa709d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Image : 210809_mainimages_usnews_saatva_Editorial (Centered)</usn-enhancement><b>Saatva Sales and Deals</b><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1685557887965,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4d7e-dfad-a9b9-6dfe5dc70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1685557887965,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4d7e-dfad-a9b9-6dfe5dc70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000183-00b8-d030-adf3-28ba78200000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;290da652-ee7f-3d3c-941b-a3678a3b8c3f&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-8669-d01a-a3a6-cfef0f6d0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">360 Lead Gen Kiosk : Saatva Seasonal Deals Kiosk</usn-enhancement><br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1685556807600,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4d7e-dfad-a9b9-6dfe5dc70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1685556807600,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000181-4d7e-dfad-a9b9-6dfe5dc70000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000170-a14a-d70f-a179-f16f3e830000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;0000016b-6bbc-d278-ad6b-ebbd124a0000&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;rankingDetailCard&quot;:true,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The WinkBed is a <a  href=\&quot;https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/mattress/hybrid-mattress\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot; data-cms-id=\&quot;00000170-8d6d-de7c-affe-bdef29470000\&quot; link-data=\&quot;{&amp;quot;link&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_ref&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;00000170-8d6d-de7c-affe-bdef29470000&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;newWindow&amp;quot;:true,&amp;quot;relations&amp;quot;:[],&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&amp;quot;},&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&amp;quot;}\&quot;>hybrid mattress</a> available in four firmness levels: Soft (a 4.5 out of 10 on the firmness scale, or medium-soft), Luxury Firm (a 6.5 out of 10, or medium-firm), Firm (a 7.5 out of 10), and Plus (an 8 out of 10). The Soft firmness level is likely best for side sleepers while Luxury Firm – The WinkBed’s most popular firmness level – could be a good fit for side, back, and stomach sleepers.<br/><br/>When we evaluated the Luxury Firm WinkBed in our labs, our petite sleep expert found the mattress to be fairly comfortable no matter what sleep position she tried. However, for a larger and taller tester who laid on the mattress in a side sleeping position, the mattress felt a bit too firm.<br/><br/>The WinkBed keeps you cool with its cover made of moisture-wicking Tencel, a eucalyptus-based fabric. A Euro pillow top with gel-infused foam provides comfort while preventing heat retention. Underneath, a layer of pocketed coils helps maximize airflow while you sleep. <br/><br/>In our hands-on evaluation of The WinkBed in a Luxury Firm feel, we did notice an initial cooling sensation that lasted a few minutes but got warmer over time. Interestingly, once you moved out of that part of the mattress, the cooling could be felt elsewhere on the mattress. You could benefit from this if you tend to change sleep positions frequently, as you’ll feel the cooling continue in different spots.<br/><br/>For a queen, The WinkBed costs <output data-point=\&quot;{&amp;quot;fieldName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;basePrice&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;56a34d48-9eee-3bb6-a54b-3dfff066d445&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;object&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;_ref&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;00000170-a14a-d70f-a179-f16f3e830000&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;_type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0000016b-6bbc-d278-ad6b-ebbd124a0000&amp;quot;}}\&quot;>$1,799</output> regardless of your chosen firmness level.

Sleeping in a room with this temperature may improve your quality of sleep.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that cooling mattresses aren’t guaranteed to work for everyone. Just like how personal factors like weight and age impact an individual’s preferences, the same goes for temperature.<br/><br/>For some, sleeping hot may be a result of stress, a health condition, or a side effect of a medication. It’s best to contact a medical professional if you have concerns.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-toc-text=""How To Buy a Cooling Mattress"" data-id=""how-to-buy"">How To Buy a Cooling Mattress</label></h2>Investing in a new mattress can be a daunting task given the financial investment, as well as the important role a mattress plays in restorative sleep. If you often overheat and are shopping for a cooling mattress, here are a few things to keep in mind that’ll help you buy the right one.<br/><br/><b>1. Decide what materials/mattress type you want.</b> Innerspring and hybrid mattresses have an inherent advantage when it comes to temperature control since hot air is easily able to leave the mattress through the coils. In addition to the type of mattress, consider heat-absorbing materials like gel infusions, phase-changing materials, and cooling fabric in the cover.<br/><br/><b>2. Verify sleep trials.</b> It can be difficult to find the best mattress while shopping <a  href=""https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/sleep/mattress/best-online-mattress"" target=""_blank"" data-cms-id=""00000179-3d0c-d3b5-ad7f-ff9f87cd0000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000179-3d0c-d3b5-ad7f-ff9f87cd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000172-28f5-d52d-a176-3dfda9770000&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">online</a> from direct-to-consumer brands since you don’t get the chance to feel the mattress in person before ordering. Looking for a mattress with an at-home sleep trial gives you the opportunity to try it out and send it back within the return window if it doesn’t sleep cool enough for you.<br/><br/><b>3. Read the fine print.</b> While it might not be the most entertaining reading material, the fine print is an important consideration when purchasing a mattress. Be sure to check the warranty duration and what it covers. It’s also important to know how returns work. Some mattress companies accept returns within the initial sleep trial period at no cost, but others, like Saatva, charge a processing fee for returns. Check the shipping policy, as well as what delivery will look like and the estimated time frame between ordering the bed and when it’ll show up.<br/><br/><b>4. Consider your other bedding.</b> If temperature control is a top priority while sleeping, consider if your bedding is working with or against your mattress.

Foam mattresses conform closely to the sleeper and the solid makeup doesn’t allow for much air circulation, making these more prone to trapping body heat.<br/><br/>To mitigate this problem, most cooling foam models use infusions. For instance, gel memory foam provides sleepers with the same cushioning comfort as traditional foam but with added cooling. Also, foams with an open-cell construction are better at boosting airflow.<br/><br/>Sleepers who experience night sweats may want to consider a hybrid mattress because hybrids tend to be more breathable than all-foam models.

Are you looking to convert a room to more usable space? Are you simply ready for a change? Understanding your motivation behind the project will give you a better idea of how to apply your budget and prioritize tasks as well as whether you should tap professional help.<br/><br/>Here are five primary reasons you may want to remodel your house:<br/><ul><li> Maintenance.</li><li> Update rooms.</li><li> Try out new styles.</li><li> Get ready to sell.</li><li> Improve efficiency.</li></ul><br/><h3><b>For Maintenance</b> </h3><br/>Whether the house is five or 105 years old, maintenance is required to keep everything working smoothly. Especially if your house is decades old, you'll likely find the electrical, plumbing and even the foundation may need a little love to maintain a safe, stable structure for you and your family.<br/><br/>A renovation project driven mainly by the need for maintenance will likely mean the majority of the budget goes toward hiring licensed professionals and replacing dated materials. Depending on where you live, extensive work on the structure or electrical or plumbing systems may require permits and an inspection.<br/><br/><h3><b>To Update Rooms</b></h3><br/>The plumbing may still be OK, but a 1980s kitchen might be an eyesore. Plenty of homeowners remodel to bring a space out of decades past and into current times.<br/><br/>For a kitchen or bathroom, much of the renovation budget may go toward new appliances. These updates may also involve high-cost materials like marble, new tile and custom cabinetry.<br/><br/>As a result, consider splitting your budget between updating the function and the appearance of the room.<br/><br/><h3><b>To Try Out New Styles</b></h3><br/>You may have redone the living room 10 years ago, but those beige walls now make your stomach churn.

In many cases, this might be a small remodeling job, so the budget can be dedicated to paint, furnishings or other decorative materials.<br/><br/>Because trends are, by definition, fairly short-lived, avoid taking on a major renovation purely for the sake of embracing a new trend. Stephen Pallrand, owner and president of Home Front Build, a design-build and renovation company based in Los Angeles, recommends keeping the original style of the house's architecture in mind. <br/><br/>""The mistake a lot of people make is you walk into a Spanish colonial or even Craftsman house, and then you see a 1990s Home Depot kitchen or a modern kitchen,"" he says.<br/><br/><h3><b>To Get Ready to Sell</b> </h3><br/>Homeowners who are prepping their house for the market may need to make minor repairs, give rooms a <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/house-painting-rules-you-should-never-break"" data-cms-id=""00000155-4a14-d393-a9f5-fabc82180001"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000155-4a14-d393-a9f5-fabc82180001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">fresh coat of paint</a> or install a trendy backsplash to appeal to buyers when they tour the property.<br/><br/>When selling is the goal, home improvements are aimed at maximizing the return on investment.

Homeowners spent a median of $20,000 to renovate their kitchen and a median of $13,500 to update the primary bathroom.<br/><br/>Homeowners aren't just looking for a fresh, customized look in the common areas of the house – they're focusing on the more personal areas as well. On average, homeowners renovate three rooms at a time, says Marine Sargsyan, economist for Houzz.<br/><br/>Popular room updates include:<br/><ul><li>  Kitchen.</li><li>  Guest bathroom.</li><li>  Primary bathroom.</li><li>  Living room or family room.</li><li>  Primary bedroom.</li><li>  Outdoor living.</li><li>  Dining room.</li><li>  Home office.</li><li>  Master closet.</li></ul><h3></h3><h2><label  data-toc-text=""Apply for permits."" data-id=""apply"">Apply for Permits</label></h2><br/>Depending on where you live and the scope of your work, you may need to <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/5-must-ask-questions-about-code-violations-in-your-home"" data-cms-id=""0000017e-985a-de33-afff-ddff9e540000"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;content&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017e-985a-de33-afff-ddff9e540000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60012&quot;},&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">apply for a permit</a> for any work you do through your city, township or county. Permits are most often required to ensure work is completed properly to avoid posing a threat to you and your neighbors in the future. Structural work on a home, like an addition, significant electrical work and major plumbing changes, are examples of some of the most common permit-required work.<br/><br/>Many cities offer permit applications online, though others will have people visit in person at city hall or the local planning office.<br/><br/>When you apply for a permit you may need to pay a small fee as well. Depending on the project, you may need blueprints or other formal plans to obtain your permit. Many general contractors oversee the permitting process on behalf of their clients, but you should clarify this detail before signing a contract – a miscommunication on who is responsible for permits can slow down the renovation process significantly.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""inspiration"">Find Inspiration From Styles and Trends That Appeal to You</label></h2><br/>Even if your renovation is motivated by a repair or preparation to <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/the-guide-to-selling-your-home"" data-cms-id=""00000164-8aed-df43-abfe-dafd22450000"" data-cms-href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/the-guide-to-selling-your-home"">sell your house</a>, envision what the finished space will look like and what styles or trends will appeal to you or a would-be buyer. <br/><br/>Start by getting an initial feel for the project by looking online, says Leah Tuttleman, an interior designer certified by the American Society of Interior Designers and corporate designer for Re-Bath, a full-service bathroom remodeling brand.<br/><br/>""Always do a little bit of research on your own to understand what your style is that you gravitate towards,"" she says. It's not just about knowing what you want the room to look like, but realistically taking your budget into account as well.<br/><br/>Know that if you fully embrace a current style or trend – whether it's the farmhouse-chic look or a minimalist, modern aesthetic – it may eventually look dated, simply because styles evolve and interior design trends fall out of favor.<br/><br/>Whether you're looking to update a room or incorporate a few trendy pieces, there are some areas where it's easier to embrace a trend than others. Here are a few examples:<br/><br/><h3><b>Lighting</b></h3><br/>You always have the option to make permanent lighting changes or simply add lamps throughout a room. Recessed lighting is currently popular and considered a classic, long-lasting look, although track lighting, which many now consider dated, may have once held the same appeal.<br/><br/><h3><b>Color</b></h3><br/>Embrace the hottest colors of the year – Pantone's 2023 color of the year is <a  href=""https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/what-is-viva-magenta"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/what-is-viva-magenta&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Viva Magenta</a>, a rich, somewhat futuristic crimson  – by painting your living room walls or buying an accent pillow. Trade out the dark-stained wood floors of the 2010s for a lighter or varied stain option. Paint your front door to make it pop. Bring in a multicolored rug to infuse some life into your guest bedroom. Color trends change annually and month to month, and they're fortunately fairly easy to implement and switch out in a room.<br/><br/><h3><b>Furnishings</b></h3><br/>The simplest, least permanent way to bring in a current style or trend is with furnishings. Lamps, couches and a coffee table in the midcentury modern style may be exactly the look you're going for now, while midcentury modern wallpaper will likely be a change you'll regret in a couple years.<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000016c-f77e-df20-a9ec-fffe39330000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-9148-d197-a1e8-d1f848130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : How Do I Find My Property Lines?

Most projects also end up costing a hefty sum – 76% of renovation projects in 2022 were over $10,000.<br/><br/>Homeowners are taking on plenty of small-scale projects around the house as well. Projects under $5,000 made up 12% of the share of renovations among surveyed homeowners in the Houzz study.<br/><br/>Here's how you may choose to fund your remodel:<br/><br/><h3><b>Cash</b></h3><br/>Most homeowners don't want to take on additional debt to fund their home updates or renovations. In fact, 82% use cash from savings, according to the Houzz report. Necessary renovations for system updates or, say, a water heater breakdown are often considered good reasons to tap a rainy day fund.<br/><br/>When using savings, however, be sure to budget accurately from start to finish on the project. You don't want to get halfway through a bathroom remodel and run out of money, leaving your bathroom unusable for the next six months while you save.<br/><br/><h3><b>Financing Options</b></h3><br/>For major renovations and home rehabilitations, financing the updates will likely get you to project completion faster. You have the option to take out a <a  href=""https://loans.usnews.com/home-equity-lenders"">home equity loan</a>, which allows you to borrow an amount based on your home's value – specifically, the equity you currently have in it based on how much of the mortgage you've paid off. According to the Houzz study, 16% of all homeowners who renovated in 2022 used a secured home loan to finance the job.<br/><br/>Home equity loans are a great option for home improvement projects because they can increase the value of your property, but borrowing for frivolous spending can lead to financial problems down the road. Only borrow what you feel confident you can pay back over time.<br/><br/><h5><b>Credit card</b></h5><br/>The Houzz report notes the use of credit cards to fund a home renovation made up 28% of renovating homeowners' responses in 2022, a drop from its peak in 2019 of 35%. <br/><br/>In the short term, placing the cost on your <a  href=""https://creditcards.usnews.com/"">credit card</a> can be a helpful way to take advantage of available credit, but it can quickly lead to problems in the form of added interest or long-term financial struggles should you default on your credit card payments.<br/><br/><h2>Estimated Remodel and Upgrade Costs</h2><br/><h3>Room Renovation </h3><br/>According to the Houzz study, this is the median amount that homeowners spent on renovations by room in 2022.<br/><br/><table ><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><b>Room</b></td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><b>Median renovation cost</b></td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Kitchen</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$20,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Primary Bathroom</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$13,500</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Secondary bathroom</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$5,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Living or family room</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$5,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Primary bedroom</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$2,500</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Secondary bedroom</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$1,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Laundry room</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$3,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Closet</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$1,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Dining room</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$2,000</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">Home office</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">$2,000</td></tr></table>Major kitchen and bathroom remodels were more expensive than ever in 2022.

There are lower-cost and luxury options for every kind of material you may need, but you'll also want to weigh how the space will be used when determining where to splurge and where to save. High-end materials may be ideal for a room or item that you'll use and notice every day, while you may be able to save with lower-cost materials for details that are less important for daily life.<br/><br/><h3><label  data-id=""demolish"">Demolish the Space</label></h3><br/>When working with a contractor, you may be able to save a bit of money by offering to demolish the existing room on your own.

If you've hired professionals, it's best to let them take control – a general contractor will oversee subcontractors doing specialized work, whether it's electrical components, tile installation or a buildout for custom cabinets. You've hired experienced hands for a reason, so don't micromanage.<br/><br/>""Not everything seems logical to an inexperienced eye,"" Tuttleman says. It's important to allow a hired project manager – whether it's the general contractor or interior designer – to be in charge of ensuring everything gets done as efficiently as possible. More sound advice: Avoid last-minute change requests and be clear on your expectations from the start.<br/><br/>By the point that either you or contractors are working on the space and installing anything from walls to appliances, you want to feel confident about the style and material choices you've made. ""That should take serious consideration, because once things are ordered, you have almost no ability to return anything,"" Tuttleman says.<br/><br/><h3><label  data-id=""inspections"">Have Required Inspections Completed</label></h3><br/>If your renovation involves any major electrical, plumbing or structural work, there's a good chance your local municipality will require an <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/a-checklist-for-home-inspections"" data-cms-id=""00000167-37d1-d388-a3e7-f7d983220000"" data-cms-href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/a-checklist-for-home-inspections"">inspection</a> to approve the permitted work. This inspection ensures the work was done properly and won't be a danger to the home or anyone in it.<br/><br/>A beginning-to-end general contractor will often handle the permit application and inspection scheduling process as part of the total cost of the project, though that is something you should clarify in advance. Otherwise, you are responsible for providing the paperwork in advance and scheduling the inspection. For some work, like plumbing, the inspection must be conducted before walls are installed to cover up the pipes, so be sure you don't skip this key step in the renovation process.<br/><br/><h3><label  data-id=""finishing-touches"">Add Finishing Touches</label></h3><br/>Finally, you've completed the more labor-intensive work and are able to assemble the space with furniture and decor. In a kitchen or bathroom, this often involves merely stocking the drawers, shelves and cabinets with the items you normally keep in the space. For a living room or bedroom, you're moving furniture around, placing art and finding the best spot for tabletop accessories.<br/><br/>If you're working with an interior designer or full-service renovation company that includes interior design, the professional will continue working with you throughout this phase. But this is the time to really make the space your own, from the angle of the sofa to the TV to the decor on your shelves, and enjoy your newly renovated home.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686858157880,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-e27e-de4b-a7cf-eaffc1c90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686858157880,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000184-e27e-de4b-a7cf-eaffc1c90000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000168-ba7b-d97b-a77b-bffb8c5c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff7000f&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;showTitleOnEmbed&quot;:true,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-c094-d992-afd9-ffbdd0b40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;04a89d22-d3e6-3558-ab54-be22c9c29555&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-9148-d197-a1e8-d1f8481f0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Listicle : 10 Home Renovations Under $5,000 (230327realestate.homerenovationsunder5000) (1 PV)</usn-enhancement>","real estate, homeownership, home improvements, personal budgets, construction",,Thu Jun 15 15:40:57 EDT 2023,Devon Thorsby

Connected to the condenser are small units for each room that are attached to a wall. Installation on exterior walls is typically preferred for connecting copper tubing to the exterior condenser.<br/><br/><b>Advantage:</b> The individual units of a mini split system allow you to adjust the temperature of each room.<br/><br/><b>Disadvantage:</b> The more rooms you need to cool, the more it costs, as each space needs its own unit.<br/><br/><b>Cost:</b> A ductless system with installation typically starts around $2,000 and can reach $18,000 for a five-zone system, according to HomeAdvisor. <br/><h2><label  data-id=""window"">Window Unit or Portable Air Conditioner</label></h2><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686854849856,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-cad3-d42d-a1f0-dbdf9e570000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686854849856,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-cad3-d42d-a1f0-dbdf9e570000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000164-f223-d764-a97d-fe33b36e0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60014&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;linkList&quot;:[],&quot;removeLink&quot;:false,&quot;alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;disableCaptionCredit&quot;:false,&quot;disableHorizontalRule&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-c062-d079-a789-c0e23b070000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;e8d9e3a6-ce89-3a63-a6be-0e7419c370bb&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-c061-d3e9-a5ac-fae5f82c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Image : 180731_WindowUnitAC_Stock (Right Aligned)</usn-enhancement><br/>One of the most popular alternatives to central air is a window unit or portable air conditioner that cools a single room.<br/><br/><b>Advantage:</b> A portable air conditioner or window unit is one of the fastest and easiest ways to effectively cool a room.

With a fan and water-soaked sponge or pad, air is blown by the fan through the pad, allowing the water-cooled air to blow into the room or the rest of the house. To cool the house and manage the temperature from room to room, you crack windows to allow the hot air to escape, leaving the cooled air.<br/><br/><b>Advantage:</b> With a fan and small amount of water use while running, a swamp cooler is much cheaper to operate than refrigerant air conditioning. You’ll be pleased with lower <a  href=""https://realestate.usnews.com/real-estate/articles/how-to-set-up-your-utilities"">utility</a> bills.<br/><br/><b>Disadvantage:</b> With water serving as a cooling factor, a swamp cooler, which is often installed on the roof for whole-house cooling, only works where humidity is low. For example, at 50% relative humidity, you’re able to achieve around a 10-degree difference. The more humid the air is, the less effectively you’re able to cool.<br/><br/><b>Cost:</b> Home services company Angi reports most swamp cooler installations cost between $1,558 and $3,751. There are some in-room evaporative cooler fans sold at home goods stores for as little as $60. <br/><h2><label  data-id=""attic"">Attic Fan</label></h2><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686855483908,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-cad3-d42d-a1f0-dbdf9e570000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686855483908,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-cad3-d42d-a1f0-dbdf9e570000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000188-c06b-d7b0-a1fb-eefb06700000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff60014&quot;},&quot;overrideData&quot;:{&quot;linkList&quot;:[],&quot;removeLink&quot;:false,&quot;alignment&quot;:&quot;RIGHT&quot;,&quot;disableCaptionCredit&quot;:false,&quot;disableHorizontalRule&quot;:false,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-c06b-d695-a5bf-e8efebc60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;e8d9e3a6-ce89-3a63-a6be-0e7419c370bb&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-c06a-d3fa-afcd-e27ae9620000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Image : 230615_Attic_Stock (Right Aligned)</usn-enhancement><br/>A slightly simplified version of a swamp cooler, an attic fan avoids humidity limitations and works best for areas or days when the weather outside isn’t too hot.

The Russian leader appears eager to assure his domestic audience of his military’s prospects, despite troubling realities about Russia’s troop strength and the limits of its industrial base to keep up with the military’s needs.<br/><br/>And for the first days of the counteroffensive, his voice was the most prominent, as the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy avoided publicly confirming battlefield details – good or bad – and its Western backers deferred questions to Kyiv.<br/><br/>“Putin may be attempting to systematically amplify and misrepresent Ukrainian losses of Western military equipment to portray Ukraine’s counteroffensive as failed and discourage the West from continuing to support Ukraine,” the independent Institute for the Study of War concluded in an analysis note earlier this week. “Former Russian officer and ardent ultranationalist Igor Girkin observed that Putin’s comments indicate that the Russian Ministry of Defense continues to misinform him about the true situation on the battlefield.”<br/><br/>Austin on Thursday acknowledged it is “far too early to make any definitive assessments” of the state of Ukraine’s attempts to break the deadlock and tempered expectations of the near future: “It’s uncertain, it’s violent and, as always, it’s high-cost.”<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1686846583988,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000154-0691-d75e-a95c-2fdd7a650000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1686846583988,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000154-0691-d75e-a95c-2fdd7a650000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000188-b100-df54-afeb-b14051570000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000188-bfe3-d3c6-a3ae-bff3acfd0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : Drones Hit Russian Border Towns (https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2023-06-09/drones-fell-on-russian-border-towns-as-fears-rise-of-ukraine-based-attacks)</usn-enhancement>“This will continue to be a tough fight, as we anticipated,” Austin said, stressing the need for Western countries to remain steadfast in their support for Ukraine – even as some domestic voices begin to question the value of the multibillion-dollar investments.<br/><br/>Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who spoke alongside Austin, similarly said it would be “premature” to estimate how long Ukraine’s war will take, noting that hundreds of thousands of Russian troops are dug in at fortified and prepared positions all along the front lines.<br/><br/>“This is a very difficult fight, this is a very violent fight, and it will likely take a considerable amount of time at high cost,” Milley said. “At the end of the day, as Napoleon once said, the moral is to the physical as three is to one.”<br/><br/>And he touted what he considers Ukraine’s advantages: “The Ukrainian morale, their leadership, their skill, their tenacity, their resilience is high.”<br/><br/>“The Russians, on the other hand, their leadership is not necessarily coherent, their troop morale is not high. They’ve been sitting in defensive positions. Many of them don’t even know why they’re there,” he said, concluding, “It’s too early to tell.

Even if your credit has remained the same, refinancing could still make sense.<br/><br/>If your credit score has decreased, your odds of obtaining more favorable credit terms are low.<br/><br/><h3>Shop Around</h3>You can refinance your car loan with your existing lender, but before you do so, take some time to compare terms from several <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/loans/auto-loans/best-auto-loans"">top auto lenders</a>. Look at things like interest rates, terms and eligibility criteria.<br/><br/>While one lender may offer a better interest rate, it may have vehicle age or mileage restrictions or shorter repayment terms than you're comfortable with.<br/><br/>Some lenders have preapproval tools that can provide you with quotes after just a soft credit check, which won't impact your credit score. Others, however, may require you to submit an official application to get an offer.<br/><br/><h3>Choose a Lender and Apply</h3>Once you've decided which lender is best for you, submit an application. You'll typically need to provide several pieces of information and documentation during the process, including:<br/><ul><li>Your current lender's information.</li><li>A 10-day payoff amount.</li><li>Your personal information, including your name, date of birth, Social Security number, address and contact information.</li><li>Employment and income information and documentation.</li><li>The car's vehicle identification number, make, model, year and mileage.</li><li>Evidence of insurance coverage.</li></ul>After you submit the application, the lender will use a guide like the National Automobile Dealers Association book to assess the vehicle's value. It'll also run a credit check and review the vehicle details to determine whether you qualify and what your interest rate will be.<br/><br/><h3>Accept the Offer</h3>If the lender approves your application, it'll provide you with the offer details, including a rate, monthly payment, repayment term and other important information.<br/><br/>Note that a car refinance typically doesn't include closing costs, which are standard for mortgage refinance loans. ""Refinancing with someone else or your same lender can be an easy process and, in most cases, lower your monthly payment, helping you save money,"" says Zander Cook, chief operating officer and co-founder of Lease End, a company that helps drivers buy out or refinance their leases. ""Combine this perk with a lack of closing costs, and you may be saving more.""<br/><br/>If you agree to the terms, sign the offer and return it to the lender. You may be able to complete the process online, though you may need to speak with a loan officer over the phone or in person at some point.<br/><br/>From start to finish, refinancing an auto loan typically takes between one and two weeks.<br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1669055701071,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000176-196b-d19f-a377-1f7b53460000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1669055701071,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000176-196b-d19f-a377-1f7b53460000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-450e-d8d7-a79f-570ebe350000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000145-ffe0-d1b0-afcd-ffe015380000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000184-9b78-d815-afff-ff7896880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Related Link Enhancement : Compare Auto Refinance Loans, Lenders and Rates (https://money.usnews.com/loans/auto-loans/best-auto-refinance-loans)</usn-enhancement><h2>Reasons to Refinance Your Auto Loan</h2>There are a few reasons why you might consider refinancing a car loan, including:<br/><ul><li><b>Lower interest rate.</b> If interest rates have gone down in general, you may be able to secure a lower rate even if your credit score has remained the same. ""If your financial standing has improved since taking your loan, you could take advantage of better interest rates for even greater savings,"" says Cook.</li><li><b>Lower monthly payment.</b> A lower interest rate can naturally reduce the loan's monthly payment, but you could also get a lower payment by extending your repayment term. ""It may be beneficial to extend the term to secure a lower monthly payment and create additional disposable income to pay other monthly bills,"" says Benita Pender, consumer lending manager at Tropical Financial Credit Union. Keep in mind, though, that extending your term may result in more interest charges over the life of your loan.</li><li><b>Shorter repayment term. </b>If you want to pay off your loan faster and can afford a higher monthly payment, refinancing with a shorter repayment period can help you accomplish your goal. What's more, opting for a shorter term can improve your chances of getting a lower interest rate.</li><li><b>Tap your equity. </b>Some lenders allow car owners to get a <a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/loans/auto-loans/articles/what-is-a-cash-out-auto-refinance"">cash-out refinance loan</a>, allowing them to access some or all of the equity they have in their car.

Here are some situations where it may not make sense:<br/><ul><li><b>Your credit score has declined. </b>If your credit is in worse condition than it was when you got your current loan, your chances of saving money with a lower interest rate may be low, even if interest rates have gone down in the meantime.</li><li><b>You'll have to pay a prepayment penalty. </b>Prepayment penalties can average 2% of the remaining loan balance. The average auto loan balance was $20,987 in 2021, according to <a  href=""https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/auto-loan-debt-study/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/auto-loan-debt-study/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Experian</a>, which would translate to a penalty of roughly $420. Depending on how much you can save over time with your new loan, it may not be worth the upfront cost.</li><li><b>Your car is almost paid off. </b>Refinance lenders have a minimum loan amount they'll issue. Depending on your current balance, you may not be able to meet the minimum loan amount for the lenders you're considering. Even if you do, if you can pay off the loan in the next year or two, extending that term to three or more years may cost you far more in the long run.</li><li><b>You're upside down. </b>If you have negative equity in your car, you may have a hard time finding a lender willing to refinance your existing loan. If one does, the interest rate may be too high to make the process worth it.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>What Comes Next?</h2>Now that you know how to refinance your car loan, review your situation and your financial goals and consider how an auto loan refinance can help. Take your time to assess your credit situation and your options, and don't be afraid to back out if you decide that it's not the right move for you.<br/><br/>If now isn't the right time, continue to evaluate your auto loan regularly to avoid missing out on better terms in the future.

Another significant cost is the interest you have to pay on your car loan.<br/><br/>With the average used car costing far&nbsp;more than $20,000, most buyers have to take out an auto loan to afford the purchase.

The interest is the cost of renting the money. It covers the bank's cost of doing business, its profit&nbsp;and pays for the risk involved in lending you money.<br/><br/>Lenders look at several factors when deciding what interest rate to charge. First, they have to cover the cost they have to pay the Federal Reserve (often referred to as “the Fed”) that lends them the money they lend to you. When the Fed keeps interest rates low, banks, credit unions&nbsp;and other lenders can keep their auto loan rates lower. When the Fed's rates are higher, as they are today, auto loans become more expensive. <br/><br/>Another major factor lenders consider when pricing loans is risk. While your job history, assets&nbsp;and other information on your loan application play a part in determining your creditworthiness, the most significant risk indicator is your credit score. Drawn on information found in your credit report, your credit score is a three-digit number that reflects your history of making on-time payments, how much credit you have available&nbsp;and how much credit you are using. Though it's sometimes referred to as a FICO score, the FICO scoring model is just one of many models used by credit reporting bureaus Equifax, Experian&nbsp;and TransUnion. You actually have many credit scores, but the numbers are usually pretty close to one another.<br/><br/>The higher your credit score, the more a lender believes you will make timely payments and ultimately pay off the loan. The lower your score, the less faith they have that the loan will be repaid. Take a look at our articles on <a  href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjRulGI9Bt3cJn7OSrWu-xpzComr6yBhBFJ27IwSL2E/edit#bookmark=id.30j0zll"">how financing a car works</a> and our guide to <a  href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjRulGI9Bt3cJn7OSrWu-xpzComr6yBhBFJ27IwSL2E/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te"">car loans and leasing</a> to learn more about borrowing money to buy a car.<br/><br/>How long you plan to take to pay off the loan also figures into the interest rate you are charged. The longer the loan, the higher the risk that you'll stop paying at some point. A higher interest rate helps the lender recoup more of the car’s value early in the loan, somewhat protecting them if the loan goes bad. Four-year loan terms will almost always have lower interest rates than five- or six-year car loans.<br/><br/>Used car loans typically have higher interest rates than new car financing because there’s more uncertainty as to the value of the car, and lenders can demonstrate that used car borrowers default more frequently on their auto loans, regardless of their credit.<br/><br/><a  href=""https://money.usnews.com/loans/auto-loans/best-auto-loans"">[SEE: Best Auto Loan Lenders &amp; Rates]</a><br/><br/><h2><label  data-toc-text=""How Do I Get a Lower Car Loan Rate?"" data-id=""h-how-do-i-get-a-lower-car-loan-rate"">How Do I Get a Lower Car Loan Rate?</label></h2>There are several ways to ensure you can get the best car loan interest rate.<br/><br/><h3>Improve Your Credit Score</h3>The most sure-fire way is to improve your credit score by making on-time payments for all of your bills and working to pay off any debts that are dragging the score down. Showing that you can pay your bills on time and lowering your debt-to-income ratio demonstrates to lenders that you are financially responsible. Unfortunately, moving your credit score upward takes a significant amount of time.<br/><br/>You can get a free copy of your credit reports from each of the leading credit reporting agencies for free once a year at annualcreditreport.com. It's essential that you do so because many reports contain errors. Correcting those errors can improve your score.<br/><br/><h3>Get a Preapproval</h3>It is critical that you have a preapproved auto loan in place before you start your car shopping. Leaving your financing up to a dealer opens you up to a lousy loan deal, where you have to pay too much interest.<br/><br/>Dealers make a large part of their profit by marking up the interest rate they offer you on loan packages from third-party lenders. When you have a preapproved offer in place, you'll set a benchmark they have to beat to earn your financing business.<br/><br/>You can shop around at several lenders and apply online for loans. As long as you do so in a short span of time (to limit the impact on your credit score), there’s no problem with applying to several lenders to see which can offer you the best deal. A common guideline is to complete all of your loan applications within about three weeks. U.S. News partner myAutoLoan can get you up to four offers with just one online application.<br/><br/>If the credit challenge that caused a decline in your score was caused by a temporary event, such as an injury that prevented you from working or a job loss, and you’re back on track toward improved credit, it might be worth your time to sit down with a loan officer at a smaller bank or credit union. Smaller lenders often have more flexibility in setting rates. If you can demonstrate you’re a better risk than your score indicates, you might get a better interest rate.<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-a3a3-dc41-a1db-a3eff6fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000153-adc1-d286-af7b-bde7ea070000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-a53e-dc41-a1db-a57ffecc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Static Template Reference : components/pages/autos/widgets/finance/MyAutoloanStrip.js</usn-enhancement><h3>Keep Your Loan Short and Small</h3>By keeping your loan as short as possible and paying a significant amount of money down, you’ll often qualify for a lower rate. Making a large down payment and keeping the loan amount to a minimum lowers your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Lenders love low LTVs and dislike high LTVs.<br/><br/><h3>Take Advantage of a Used Car Deal</h3>Shoppers who purchase certified used cars (CPO cars) from franchised new car dealerships can often take advantage of <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/best-car-deals"">special deals</a> offered by carmakers with below-market interest rates. Unfortunately, you won’t generally find cash rebates with used cars as you'll find on new cars, but a discounted auto loan interest rate can save car buyers a good deal of money.<br/><br/>CPO cars are gently used models that are typically a couple of model years old with low mileage and no history of accidents. Carmakers provide warranty coverage on the vehicles, which can provide significant savings in repair costs. Many of them were leased as new cars and were trade-ins at the end of their leases. Car deals come with many restrictions and are usually available to buyers with well-above-average credit scores.<br/><br/><h3>Refinance to a Lower Interest Rate</h3>Even if you have to buy a car while you have a bad credit score, there's still an opportunity to save money down the road. After paying on time for a year or so, your score will likely have moved up. By refinancing your loan with your improved score, you may be able to lower the interest rate on your auto loan significantly. Read our article on <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/refinance-car-loan-temp"">refinancing your car loan</a> to learn more.<br/><br/><h3>Make Your Payments</h3>The best way to improve your credit score and ensure you don’t default on your auto loan is to make your payments on time. Setting up automatic payments from your bank account to your lender is an easy way to ensure your loan repayment goes smoothly. If you have your auto loan at the same financial institution as your checking account, setting up an autopay is easy. If they’re at different places, most banks and credit unions have online bill pay systems that can be used to set up your monthly car payments.",,,Thu Jun 15 09:38:00 EDT 2023,"John M.

The average price of a new car is more than $36,000, and a used car costs more than $20,000 on average. However, for many buyers, a car’s price doesn’t tell the entire story about what it costs to buy it. Because most people take out a loan to buy a car, the interest rate on their auto loan drives the final cost of the car up. In fact, an auto loan’s interest rate is usually the second most expensive part of buying a car. If you can get a good auto loan interest rate, you can save thousands. &nbsp;<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-a3a3-dc41-a1db-a3eff6fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000153-adc1-d286-af7b-bde7ea070000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-a541-dc41-a1db-a56f85e50000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Static Template Reference : components/pages/autos/widgets/finance/MyAutoloanStrip.js</usn-enhancement><h2><label  data-toc-text=""Average Auto Loan Rates"" data-id=""h-auto-loan-rates-in-august-2022"">Average Auto Loan Rates in June 2023</label></h2><table ><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><b>Credit Score</b></td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><b>New Car Loan</b></td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><b>Used Car Loan</b></td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""><b>Refinance Car Loan</b></td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">750 or higher</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">11.25%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">11.50%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">7.19%</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">700-749</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">11.96%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">12.21%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">7.97%</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">600-699</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">16.89%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">17.14%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">9.84%</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">451-599</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">21.53%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">21.78%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">12.57%</td></tr><tr ><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">450 or lower</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">22.41%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">22.66%</td><td colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1""  colspan=""1"" rowspan=""1"">N/A</td></tr></table>These rates were supplied by our partner, <a  href=""https://www.myautoloan.com/partner/usnews.html?utm_distil=usnews&amp;source=usnews&amp;site=MAL&amp;type=features&amp;term=editorial_links"">MyAutoloan</a>.

When the federal reserve keeps interest rates low, borrowing money to buy a car tends to be less expensive.&nbsp;Today, the Federal Reserve is pushing interest rates higher to help curb inflation, which is making borrowing money for a car more expensive. <br/><br/>After rates set by the Federal Reserve, your credit score has the most impact on the car loan interest rate you’ll pay. If you have a good credit score, you’ll qualify for a lower interest rate. When you finance a car, you borrow the amount of money you need to buy the car, and the lender charges you interest. The interest is basically rent on the money you borrow. It allows the lender to cover their expenses, make a profit and get more of their money back if you default on a loan. You can read more about <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/how-to-finance-a-car-temp"">how financing a car works</a> and check out our guide to <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/car-loans-and-leasing"">car loans and leasing</a> for more details.<br/><br/>Lenders can show that, on average,&nbsp;people with low credit scores are&nbsp;less likely to pay back the money they borrow. Factors that can contribute to a low credit score include things like being late on loan payments and other bills, having a high level of debt, or failing to repay loans. All of these factors indicate that a borrower has trouble managing money.<br/><br/>Other factors that impact your auto loan rate are the type and length of the loan. <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/used-cars/financing-a-used-car-feature"">Used-car loans</a> have a higher interest rate than new-car loans because used cars have a lower resale value than new cars and the values of used cars are&nbsp;less predictable. If you default on a used car loan, the lending company will be left with a lower-value asset to sell. They charge more interest to protect themselves and recoup more of their money in case the loan goes into default.<br/><br/>The length of the loan you’re looking for also affects your interest rate. A longer loan term means lower monthly payments, but it also means that you’ll be taking longer to pay the lender back and there's a higher risk that you won't follow through on all of your payments.&nbsp;A higher interest rate helps them get more of their money back upfront, in the event you default on the loan.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-toc-text=""How Do I Get a Lower Car Loan Rate?"" data-id=""h-how-do-i-get-a-lower-car-loan-rate"">How Do I Get a Lower Car Loan Rate?</label></h2>The best way to lower your car loan interest rate is to improve your credit score. It may take a while, but if you pay bills on time and lower your debt-to-income ratio, your credit score will improve. As you get a better credit score, you will qualify for better auto loan rates, and you’ll save money on your car purchase. Read more about <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/how-to-get-a-car-loan-with-bad-credit"">how to buy a car with bad credit</a> for other ways to improve your credit score.<br/><br/>Once you have an improved credit score, shop around for car loan rate quotes. By getting quotes from multiple lenders, you’ll be able to choose the one that saves you the most money. You’ll also have an idea of what you should be paying in interest before you head to the dealership. Car dealers usually offer financing, but unless you know the rates you qualify for, you won’t know if the dealer is offering you a good or a bad financing deal. Having financing offers in hand gives the dealer an interest rate to beat if they want your financing business.<br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000182-a3a3-dc41-a1db-a3eff6fc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000153-adc1-d286-af7b-bde7ea070000&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-a541-dc41-a1db-a56f85eb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Static Template Reference : components/pages/autos/widgets/finance/MyAutoloanStrip.js</usn-enhancement>You can also save on your auto loan by choosing a shorter loan length or putting more money down on your car, which lessens the amount of money you have to borrow.<br/><br/>If you can’t raise your credit score enough to get a better car loan rate by the time you need to buy a car, you can get a loan with a higher rate, make the payments and work to <a  href=""https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/refinance-car-loan-temp"">refinance your car loan</a> to a lower rate later.

Article,Flight Canceled or Delayed? Here's What to Do (200319travel.flightdelayedorcanceled) (519 PV),Thu May 11 13:14:13 EDT 2023,Thu May 11 13:14:13 EDT 2023,"Has your flight been canceled or delayed? You're not alone. While the number of cancellations and delays has improved following last summer's mass chaos, air travel remains unpredictable. Read on to understand what's causing recent travel disruptions, what to do if you're impacted, and how to more likely avoid flight cancellations in the future. <br/><br/><h2>What to do if your flight is canceled</h2>If your flight has been canceled, remember that <a  href=""https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">federal law entitles you to a full cash refund</a> for the cost of your airfare (regardless of the reason). Follow these steps to rebook your itinerary and claim compensation. <br/><br/><h3>Get on the airline's app – or make an international call</h3>First, pull up the airline's app on your phone. Most airline apps allow you to easily rebook your flight for free, provided you can supply your six-character reservation code. Getting in line to speak with an agent and calling the airline while you wait is also a good idea (albeit slower than using an app), and social media messaging, texting or WhatsApp may prove helpful. ""During times of mass travel disruption, you should try all different avenues for getting help,"" says Nick Ewen, director of content at <a  href=""https://thepointsguy.com/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://thepointsguy.com/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">The Points Guy</a>.<br/><br/>Ewen also recommends a lesser-known tactic: calling the airline's international numbers. Airlines have offices in Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and more. ""While it can be costly, you can often get through to an agent more quickly,"" Ewen says.<br/><br/>Note that, depending on why your flight was canceled, finding seats on a new flight may be difficult and may alter your travel plans considerably.<br/><br/><h3>Reference the Cancellation and Delay Dashboard for compensation</h3>While you're entitled to a full cash refund, you may also be eligible for other compensation such as free overnight accommodations.

""If you were originally booked on the last flight of the night and there are no other options, grab a hotel room near the airport before they're all taken,"" Ewen advises.<br/><br/><h3>Request a refund</h3>If the airline cancels your flight or it's ""significantly delayed"" (a term still defined on a case-by-case basis) and you're forced to change your travel plans, the DOT requires airlines to provide a full refund. Unfortunately, getting a refund is often a lengthy and frustrating process – an issue the DOT is actively working to improve with new protections for flyers, including <a  href=""https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/air-travel-consumer-report-march-2023-and-1st-quarter-2023-numbers"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/air-travel-consumer-report-march-2023-and-1st-quarter-2023-numbers&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">$1 billion in refunds since 2021</a> and legal action against several airlines.

Once you're able to get your money back, note that reimbursement covers the total cost of airfare only and does not include other expenses associated with your trip.<br/><br/><h2>What to do if your flight is delayed</h2>In the event your flight is delayed, airlines are not legally obligated to give you a refund unless the DOT determines the delay to be ""significant."" But here's what you can do:<br/><br/><h3>Research other flights</h3>Investigate what other flights on that airline are headed to your destination and ask an agent if they can get you on one of them (without charging change fees). Also be sure to look into what's available on partner or other airlines: If Alaska, American, Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue or United don't have any flights available on your departure date, an agent will book you on a flight with a different carrier at no additional cost to you per the Cancellation and Delay Dashboard. Note, however, that airlines are not legally obligated to do this. <br/><br/><h3>Inquire about other compensation</h3>If you've been stranded at the airport for several hours, check in with an agent and reference the <a  href=""https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Commitments for Controllable Delays</a> section on the Cancellation and Delay Dashboard – regardless of whether you're able to get on another flight. Several airlines provide vouchers for meals, overnight accommodations and round-trip transportation to the airport.<br/><br/><h2>Why are flights being canceled?</h2>""There are two primary causes for the rash of controllable cancellations we saw in 2022: overscheduling and antiquated airline technology,"" says Scott Keyes, founder and chief flight expert at <a  href=""https://www.going.com/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.going.com/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Going</a> (formerly Scott's Cheap Flights).<br/><ul><li><b>Overscheduling:&nbsp;</b>""Controllable cancellations spiked around Memorial Day 2022 as travel demand bounced back quicker than expected and airlines realized they had far more flights scheduled than they were able to operate,"" Keyes explains. ""This was due in large part to the ongoing pilot shortage, but also labor shortages in other essential areas like aircraft mechanics."" The result? Full flights with few rebooking options.</li><li><b>Outdated airline technology:&nbsp;</b>""Internal systems at many airlines are built on top of 1970s technology,"" says Keyes. ""Most of the time it works fine, but on occasion when there's a lot of cancellations (even for understandable reasons like a winter storm) it can buckle under the weight."" This is exactly what happened to Southwest Airlines in December 2022; its outdated software system couldn't adequately respond to a series of winter storms, forcing the airline to leave thousands of travelers stranded.<br/></li></ul><h2>Will air travel be chaotic again this summer?</h2>Some experts say no, pointing to better preparedness by the airlines. ""Airlines are anticipating a robust travel season and have a better sense than last year of their own schedule capabilities and limitations,"" says Keyes. ""And the experience of the summer 2022 meltdown and Southwest's Christmas meltdown chastened a lot of carriers to prioritize prevention (by, say, not overscheduling) rather than maximization (putting as many flights on the schedule as possible and just hoping the pilots/planes/resources are there to support it).""<br/><br/>Others predict continued complications. While the the number of airline industry employees has grown by roughly 10% since pre-pandemic, there's still a staffing shortage – particularly for air traffic controllers and Customs and Border Protection – and outdated technology remains in place. <br/><br/><usn-enhancement data-state=""{&quot;cms.content.publishDate&quot;:1682956600900,&quot;cms.content.publishUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;cms.content.updateDate&quot;:1682956600900,&quot;cms.content.updateUser&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;0000017d-a542-de8c-a5fd-a7e673130000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ff50012&quot;},&quot;anchorable.showAnchor&quot;:false,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;_ref&quot;:&quot;00000180-5200-da2a-a7f8-f22e8c970000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;00000142-9226-d1f0-a5c6-b2f75ffa001a&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000187-d807-dd63-a3d7-facf96a60000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;4c124e31-5e46-38ed-8cb4-85979a0a6e4f&quot;}"">Raw HTML : Memorable Meanderings</usn-enhancement><br/><h2>How to avoid flight cancellations and delays in the future</h2>It's almost impossible to avoid canceled or delayed flights these days. But there are a few things you can do when booking flights to lessen your chances for travel disruptions.<br/><br/><h3>Keep tabs on your aircraft</h3>On your departure date, check your flight information before heading to the airport. You can keep a watchful eye on the flight's status – including the aircraft scheduled to operate your flight – using the airline's app or a third-party app such as FlightAware Flight Tracker (which also offers a <a  href=""https://flightaware.com/"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://flightaware.com/&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">website</a>), FlightRadar24 or TripIt Pro.<br/><br/>""As an example, if you're flying from Orlando to New York, and your plane is flying in from Chicago, the initial flight from Chicago to Orlando might be delayed (or canceled) before yours is,"" Ewen explains. ""Airlines will try to find replacement aircraft in that case, but if you can identify a potential cancellation before it officially happens, you may be able to get rebooked ahead of the other 100-plus passengers on your flight.""<br/><br/><h3>Consider an alternate airport</h3>When booking your flight, you may consider flying out of a different airport than the one you typically depart from. For example, a small regional airport with limited routes may mean less travel delays and hassle overall – or it may be worth driving further to another international airport for a nonstop flight to your destination rather than opting for a connecting flight close to home.<br/><br/><h3>Fly in the morning</h3>While flight disruptions are unpredictable, historically fewer cancellations and delays occur in the morning.<br/><br/><h3>Avoid weekend travel</h3>Fly on off-peak days like Tuesday or Wednesday.

Keep in mind that at some airports you may need to go through security or customs for your connection. For longer journeys, you can reduce the risk of missing connecting flights by planning a city stopover.

Understanding which is more relevant to you depends on the medical condition for which you’re seeking hospital quality information.<br/><br/>The Best Hospitals specialty rankings are meant for patients with life-threatening or rare conditions who need a hospital that excels in treating complex, high-risk cases. These rankings are helpful if you’re looking for information about a rare condition or difficult diagnosis that isn’t treated at many facilities.<br/><br/>Hospitals are ranked from 1 to 50 in each specialty, with hospitals not in the top 50 but still in the top 10% of all rated hospitals receiving a designation of “high performing.”<br/><br/>The Best Hospitals procedure and condition ratings focus on specific and more commonly required individual procedures and conditions, such as <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/total-hip-replacement"">hip replacement</a> and <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/conditions/heart-disease/congestive-heart-failure"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/conditions/heart-disease/congestive-heart-failure&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">heart failure</a>, rather than on broader specialties like orthopedics and cardiology. The goal is to evaluate how well hospitals perform in each procedure or condition – not just with the most challenging cases, as with the specialty rankings, but with the full range of patients.<br/><br/>Because the procedures and conditions evaluated are performed at many more hospitals than the specialties, the evaluations produce ratings rather than numerical rankings. Hospitals that treat enough patients to be evaluated are rated one of three ways for each procedure or condition: high performing, average or below average.<br/><br/>Based on your health situation, it might make more sense to go to an average hospital closer to you or within your insurance network than a high-performing hospital that isn’t.<br/><br/><div id=""best-hospitals"">As always, these ratings should be taken as a starting point. All care decisions should be made in conjunction with medical professionals.</div><br/><br/><h2>2022-2023 Best Hospitals Specialty Rankings, Published July 2022</h2>Your doctor has informed you that you're about to take your place among more than 30 million patients a year admitted to U.S. hospitals for a procedure or other care.

In 12 of the specialty areas, rankings are derived from data sources, such as Medicare:<br/><ul><li>Cancer.</li><li>Cardiology and heart surgery.</li><li>Diabetes and endocrinology.</li><li>Ear, nose and throat.</li><li>Gastroenterology and GI surgery.</li><li>Geriatrics.</li><li>Obstetrics and gynecology.</li><li>Neurology and neurosurgery.</li><li>Orthopedics.</li><li>Pulmonology and lung surgery.</li><li>Rehabilitation.</li><li>Urology.</li></ul><br/>In the remaining three specialties – ophthalmology, psychiatry and rheumatology – ranking is determined entirely by expert opinion, based on responses from three years of surveys of physician specialists who were asked to name the hospitals to which they would be inclined to refer their sickest patients.<br/><br/>The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">rankings</a> name the top 50 hospitals for complex care in each of the 12 data-driven specialties and roughly a dozen in the three expert-opinion-based specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why does U.S. News rank hospitals?</b></h3>U.S. News estimates that nearly two million hospital inpatients a year face the prospect of surgery or special care that poses either unusual technical challenges or significantly heightened risk of death or harm because of age, physical condition or existing conditions.

As noted, rankings in 12 of the 15 rely largely on objective data. Each specialty showcases the 50 top-scoring hospitals, based primarily on survival rates for particularly challenging patients, patient experience and other measures of performance that can be assessed using hard data. All evaluated hospitals and their results, including overall scores, are displayed online, but rankings are only displayed for the top 50.<br/><br/>In these 12 specialties, results from the three most recent years of an annual expert-opinion survey of specialized physicians are also factored in. Surveyed physicians are asked to name up to five hospitals they consider the best for complex cases in their specialty.<br/><br/>Except in rehabilitation; ear, nose and throat; and obstetrics and gynecology, hospitals not nationally ranked but that scored high enough in a specialty to put them in the top 10% of the analyzed centers are recognized as high performing. Hospitals nationally ranked in at least one data-determined specialty, or that earned at least six ratings of high performing and few or no low performing ratings across the 20 <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/faq-how-and-why-we-rank-and-rate-hospitals#common-care"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Hospitals procedures and conditions,</a> are further designated as <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area"">Best Regional Hospitals</a> within their state, metro area or region.<br/><br/>In the three Best Hospitals expert-opinion-based specialties, national ranking is based on the latest three annual physician surveys referenced above. Those receiving nominations from a weighted average of at least 5% of the respondents are nationally ranked Best Hospitals. Those nominated by at least 3% but below 5% of physicians are high performing. Each physician's response is assigned a weight that ensures the weighted averages represent the overall opinion of all specialists nationally, not simply those who responded.<br/><br/>The 20 hospitals with the most and highest rankings and the greatest number of high-performing procedure and condition ratings are recognized in the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"">Honor Roll</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>Are the highest-ranking hospitals always the best choices?</b></h3>Not necessarily. Hospitals are evaluated across a wide range of conditions and procedures. Within that range, hospitals can and do perform differently. In <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/pulmonology"">pulmonology and lung surgery</a>, for example, a hospital might rank below another one but do better at treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br/><br/><h3><b>So the rankings should just be a starting point?</b></h3>That's right. Patients still have to do their research and talk with their doctors. We also understand that families have to consider such factors as the stress and expense of travel and lodging in another city and their <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-insurance"">insurer's</a> willingness to pay for care if a hospital is out of network.<br/><br/><h3><b>How many hospitals were analyzed for the rankings?</b></h3>For consideration in the 12 data-driven rankings, the rankings started with about 4,500 hospitals, which represent virtually all U.S. community inpatient facilities.<br/><br/><h3><b>Are only teaching hospitals eligible for the rankings?</b></h3>No. That misconception persists, even in medical journals that make the assertion. In fact, teaching status or medical-school affiliation are only two of the four ways a hospital can be a rankings candidate.<br/><br/>Many hospitals become part of the eligible pool through two other pathways. A hospital qualified for consideration in the 12 data-driven specialties if it satisfied <i>any</i> of four criteria:<br/><ul><li>It was a teaching hospital.</li><li>It was affiliated with a medical school.</li><li>It had at least 200 beds set up and staffed.</li><li>It had at least 100 beds and offered at least four out of eight advanced technologies associated with high-quality care, such as a PET/CT scanner and certain precision radiation therapies.</li></ul>More than 2,000 hospitals met one of the four standards. Eligibility standards for the rehabilitation rankings were slightly different.<br/><br/>In the three specialties in which ranking was determined only through the last three physician surveys, any hospital with enough nominations was ranked.<br/><br/><h3><b>Does U.S. News evaluate and rank Veterans Affairs and military hospitals?</b></h3>No. Claims data for VA and military hospitals are unavailable in Medicare claims data and are largely unavailable. If these data become publicly available, we will consider evaluating them.<br/><br/><h3><b>What happens after determining initial eligibility?</b></h3>Hospitals had to show that they treated a given number of patients with explicitly-defined conditions or procedures. The threshold number for each specialty was based on traditional fee-for-service <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/medicare"">Medicare</a> inpatients discharged during the three years from 2018 to 2020 (2020 is the most recent year of available data).<br/><br/>Because the rankings focus on challenging care, only patients who had particular procedures or conditions at a defined level of severity and complexity were included.<br/><br/>A hospital that fell short was still evaluated if it was nominated by at least 1% of the physicians in a specialty who responded to 2020, 2021 and 2022 physician surveys.<br/><br/>A total of 2,203 hospitals met these standards and qualified for further consideration in at least one specialty.<br/><br/>For a schematic overview of the eligibility process for the rankings, complete with this year’s hospital population data, you can refer to page 11 of the 2022-2023 U.S. News Best Hospitals Specialty Rankings methods <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BH_Methodology_2022-23"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BH_Methodology_2022-23&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">report</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>How many hospitals were ranked?</b></h3>Across all 15 specialties, only 164 U.S. hospitals performed well enough to be nationally ranked in one or more specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>What determined whether a hospital would be ranked?</b></h3>We evaluated each hospital's performance using a variety of measures. Some data came from the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' Standard Analytical File database. Other information came from the American Hospital Association and professional organizations.<br/><br/>We put the heaviest reliance on outcomes because of the self-evident connection between a patient's outcomes, including survival, and the quality of their care. Other data, such as the number of patients and the ratio of nurses and patients, are less obviously related to quality, but ample research supports the connection. The physician survey also played a role, although it accounted for only slightly more than one-fourth of each hospital's score (see below).<br/><br/>In the three expert-opinion-based specialties, most care is delivered on an outpatient basis. The number of outpatients who die in these specialties is so low that risk-adjusted mortality rates, heavily weighted in 11 of the 12 other specialties, are not significantly tied to the quality of care. Hospitals in these specialties are therefore ranked solely on expert opinion.<br/><br/><h3><b>How were the different factors combined?</b></h3>Each hospital analyzed in 11 of the 12 data-driven rankings received an overall score from 0 to 100 based on four elements:<br/><ul><li>Outcomes (including survival rate and the rate at which patients were able to return home rather than needing additional institutional care).</li><li>Patient experience.</li><li>Care-related factors such as the intensity of nurse staffing and the breadth of patient services.</li><li>Expert opinion obtained through the physician survey. (Rehabilitation used a unique methodology, as described in the methodology report.)</li></ul>The hospitals with the 50 highest scores in each specialty were ranked. Scores and data for all eligible hospitals in each specialty are also posted. The four elements and their weightings are, in brief:<br/><br/><b>Patient Outcomes (37.5%)</b><br/>A hospital's success at keeping patients alive accounted for 30% of its score. U.S. News compared the number of Medicare inpatients with certain conditions who died within 30 days of admission in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with the number who would be expected to die given the severity of illness.<br/><br/>Hospitals were scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the highest statistical likelihood that the survival rate was better than expected and 1 indicating that survival rates were worse than expected. U.S. News' calculation of each hospital's expected deaths factored in:<br/><ul><li>The age and sex of each patient.</li><li>What kind of care they needed.</li><li>What other illnesses (known as comorbidities) were present.</li><li>Whether they received Medicaid benefits ( a measure of socioeconomic status).</li><li>Other risk factors known to influence patients' outcomes.</li></ul><b>Patient Experience (5%)</b><br/>This score reflects the percentage of patients who responded positively to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS, a survey about the overall quality of their hospital stay. Most hospitals are required to assess patients' satisfaction using the HCAHPS survey.<br/><br/><b>Other Care-Related Indicators (30%)</b><br/>These include nurse staffing, patient volume, certain clinically proven technologies and professional and specialty-specific recognition. The 2020 American Hospital Association Annual Survey was the primary source.<br/><br/><b>Expert Opinion (27.5%)</b><br/>Each year, board-certified physicians in the relevant specialties are invited to list up to five hospitals, ignoring location and cost, that they consider to be the best in their area of expertise for complex or challenging cases.<br/><br/>The figures displayed in the rankings represent the average percentage of responding specialists in 2020, 2021 and 2022 who rated the hospitals. More than 32,000 physicians responded in 2022.<br/><br/>In three specialties – cardiology and heart surgery; obstetrics and gynecology; and neurology and neurosurgery – expert opinion received a reduced weight to accommodate public transparency metrics. Expert opinion receives a weight of 24.5% in cardiology and heart surgery and obstetrics and gynecology, and 25.5% in neurology and neurosurgery, with 3% and 2% weight, respectively, determined by the extent to which a hospital is publicly transparent about specific care-related performance metrics. Expert opinion is weighted 50.0% in rehabilitation and 27.5% in most other data-driven specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>Does reputation determine which hospitals are ranked?</b></h3>No. Many ranked hospitals have very low, even zero, reputational scores but are strong clinical performers.<br/><br/><h3><b>How are hospitals ranked in the three specialties without objective data?</b></h3>In the three expert-opinion-determined specialties, ranked hospitals had to be cited by an average of at least 5% of the physicians who responded to the latest three years of U.S. News surveys of specialists. That resulted in lists of 12 hospitals in ophthalmology, 11 in psychiatry and 11 in rheumatology.<br/><br/><h3><b>What methodology changes were made in the 2022-2023 rankings?</b></h3>Several targeted methodological revisions were implemented this year based on input from patients, clinicians, researchers and hospital leaders. These and other modifications to the methodology are described in <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">this blog post</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>How does U.S. News decide what changes to make to its methodology?</b></h3>Each year RTI International and U.S. News revisit the methodology based on the medical literature and input from hospitals and health care experts.

The No. 1-ranked hospital received 25 Honor Roll points, No. 2 received 24 points and so on. All hospitals ranked 21 through 50 received five points. The maximum number of points across these 11 specialties is 275, but no hospital has ever been No. 1 in all 12 specialties.<br/><br/>In rehabilitation and the three Best Hospitals specialty rankings based entirely on expert opinion (ranked hospitals were recommended by at least 5% of respondents to annual U.S. News physician surveys), the number of ranked hospitals varies year by year and specialty by specialty. The No. 1-ranked hospital received 10 Honor Roll points, No. 2 received nine points and so on; all hospitals ranked from 10 to the final ranked hospital received one point. If a hospital had ranked at the top in all four specialties (none was), it would have received 40 points.<br/><br/>In 16 of the 20 Best Hospitals procedures and conditions ratings, hospitals received 12 Honor Roll points for each ""high performing"" rating. “High-performing” status in AVR and TAVR resulted in six points each because these procedures are alternative treatment approaches to the same underlying condition; similarly, high performing status in ovarian cancer surgery and uterine cancer surgery resulted in six points each because tumors in these organs are treated with similar procedures.<br/><br/>Hospitals that achieved a rating of high performing in all 20 procedures and conditions, as four did, received 216 points. In some circumstances, where a health system with multiple hospitals had consolidated a certain service at a regional center of excellence, we reassigned Honor Roll points for that service from the system's center of excellence to the system's so-called flagship hospital.<br/><br/>The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Best Hospitals for Maternity</a> ratings, published on a different annual cycle, were not included in the Honor Roll calculation.<br/><br/>The 20 hospitals that earned the most points out of the 531 possible comprise the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Honor Roll</a>.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""common-care"">2022-2023 Best Hospitals Procedures and Conditions Ratings, Published July 2022</label></h2><br/>In a typical year, U.S. hospitals admit more than 30 million patients.

For each group – called cohorts – we assessed the hospital's risk-adjusted outcomes, such as 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission and length of stay. These measure how well the hospital performed the procedure at the time of care and also was able to prevent an unplanned re-visit to the hospital due to the same condition. A shorter length of stay is indicative of a lower complication rate.<br/><br/>We also factored in variables linked to higher quality of care, including volume, nurse staffing and whether the hospital employed a specially-trained physician known as an intensive care unit specialist. In addition, patient satisfaction scores were factored into the ratings for most procedures.<br/><br/>A hospital's stance on data transparency was also a factor. In our heart bypass surgery and aortic valve surgery ratings, we weighed whether the hospital had voluntarily released ratings it received from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. We factored in STS data for hospitals that had done so as of early 2022.<br/><br/><h3><b>What data sources were used?</b></h3><br/>We analyzed objective data from multiple sources, including a federal data set known as the Standard Analytical File, which contains details of every hospital admission paid for by traditional Medicare. We used SAF data on inpatients aged 65 and older treated from 2016-2020 to assess each hospital's risk-adjusted mortality rates, readmissions and other outcomes. We also used a limited amount of data from late 2015.<br/><br/>How well older patients are treated is generally considered a good test of a hospital's capabilities. Such patients have a greater chance of being admitted with one or more conditions that put them in a higher-risk category, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. We also incorporated some data from the outpatient SAF files into analysis of knee replacement procedure and stroke condition.<br/><br/>In addition, our analysis incorporated publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees Medicare. These included information on each hospital's efforts to prevent dangerous blood clots and the results from federally mandated patient-satisfaction surveys. Claims data from the Medicare database are the most comprehensive source data available. We are open to exploring alternatives for future editions of the ratings. Risk-adjusted data from clinical registries are one promising area.<br/><br/>Hospital reputation was not a factor in the ratings.<br/><br/>Our methodology also drew on several measures from the 2020 American Hospital Association's annual survey and from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, a professional organization for heart and chest surgeons. None of these organizations have endorsed or been asked to endorse the U.S. News ratings.<br/><br/><h3><b>What do the ratings mean?</b></h3><br/>An overall rating of high performing indicates a hospital was significantly better than the national average in a given procedure or condition. Hospitals rated below average scored substantially below the national average. Hospitals rated average do not all have equal performance, but they were not distinctly different from the average in our methodology. In each procedure and condition, 10% to 20% of the evaluated hospitals in a condition or procedure typically fell into the high-performing tier, and another 10% to 20% were rated below average.<br/><br/>Relatively few hospitals performed consistently across all measures for a given condition or procedure. Strengths and weaknesses in particular measures often varied considerably between hospitals with similar overall ratings. Such differences give patients flexibility by allowing them to decide, in consultation with their doctor, which qualities are most important to them. One hospital might have a lower readmission rate but have worse patient experience scores. Another might have a better balance of nurses to patients but a relatively low number of patients.<br/><br/><h3><b>Should I worry about going to a hospital rated average or below average or that is unrated?</b></h3><br/>About 50% to 70% of the hospitals in each procedure or condition were rated as average. Some of these hospitals were rated below average partly because of low patient volume, not necessarily because of a high number of deaths or other adverse events. No firm conclusion can be reached about an unrated hospital; these hospitals did not treat enough patients to be evaluated thoroughly. The ratings are just a starting point for patient decision-making, which certainly should include consulting a doctor.<br/><br/>Pending such consultation, patients who have access to a high performing or average hospital might choose that hospital over one that is below average or unrated in the type of care they need.<br/><br/><h3><b>How did U.S. News build in risk adjustment?</b></h3><br/>We took several risk factors into account:<br/><ul><li><b>Age at admission.</b></li><li><b>Sex.</b></li><li><b>Transfer status.</b> A patient transfer from the initial receiving hospital may indicate a complex procedure or condition. Patients were classified as inbound transfers if they were treated at another acute-care hospital on the day of admission, if claims data indicated they were transferred or if a previous claim indicated an outbound transfer.</li><li><b>Year of hospital admission.</b> Quality of care tends to improve over time. This means the risk of adverse outcomes is less each year. For that reason, and given that the ratings use five years of data, year of admission is included as a risk factor.</li><li><b>Comorbidities. </b>A wide range of comorbidities such as diabetes is associated with higher death rates. This means a patient has multiple diagnoses, with the primary diagnosis being treated, which typically means more challenging care. We used an inventory known as the Elixhauser comorbidities in risk adjustment.</li><li><b>Medicare eligibility status.</b> If a patient is eligible for Medicare because of age, disability or end-stage renal failure, this is a proxy for comorbidities.</li><li><b>Socioeconomic status. </b>Patients with lower incomes and education are typically sicker when they arrive at the hospital and may face more challenges in obtaining or managing their care after discharge. This can affect their risk of death, readmission and complications. When hospitals differ by the socioeconomic status of their patients, this can create bias in comparing outcomes. We used “dual eligibility” – patients eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid – as a socioeconomic factor.</li></ul><h3><b>Why did U.S. News adjust for socioeconomic status?</b></h3><br/>In 2014, the National Quality Forum, an influential standard-setting body, recommended considering socioeconomic status in certain evaluations of hospital performance. Since our objective is to enable a patient consulting our ratings to make apples-to-apples comparisons among hospitals, it follows that we should adjust for patient attributes such as age, sex and socioeconomic status.<br/><br/><h3><b>Did U.S. News consider patient satisfaction?</b></h3><br/>The methodology uses one measure, how discharged patients rated a hospital overall, from the federal government's quarterly survey called Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems, or HCAHPS.<br/><br/><h3><b>What changes were made from last year?</b></h3><br/>We made several methodology changes, as described in <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-06-29/whats-new-in-this-years-best-hospitals-methodology&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">this blog post</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>How do the U.S. News ratings compare with other public reporting on hospital quality?</b></h3><br/>In judging the validity and usefulness of any public reporting effort to evaluate health facilities, patients should ask:<br/><ul><li>What is its intention?</li><li>What information does it claim to deliver?</li><li>Does it meet the stated intent?</li></ul><br/>Our national Best Hospitals and Best Children's Hospitals rankings, for example, are meant to be used as guidance when life is in the balance or an uncommon condition or procedure is involved. Most patients, thankfully, will not need to consult them.<br/><br/>Best Hospitals for procedures and conditions, on the other hand, rates the overall quality of inpatient care in the kinds of procedures and conditions that many hospitals commonly encounter. Clinical outcomes (such as mortality, readmissions and length of stay) are stressed, but other measures included are patient volume, patient satisfaction and hospital staffing data. Patients can choose to factor some or all of these individual quality indicators into their decisions about where to get care.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""regional-hospitals"">2022-2023 Best Regional Hospitals, <b>Published July 2022</b></label></h2><br/>U.S. News first published <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Regional Hospitals</a> in 2011. These state and metro area rankings offer information on community hospitals that are highly rated but may not be nationally ranked. Regional rankings are displayed for nearly every state and for the nation's largest metro areas, provided there is at least one Best Regional Hospital located there.<br/><br/>This year, 493 hospitals in 49 states and 92 metro areas were recognized as Best Regional Hospitals. There is no separate methodology report for the regional rankings, but additional information is contained at the end of the 2022-2023 U.S. News Best Hospitals Procedures &amp; Conditions Ratings <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BHPC-Methodology-2022-2023"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BHPC-Methodology-2022-2023&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">Methodology Report</a>.<br/><br/><h3><b>What defines a Best Regional Hospital?</b></h3><br/>A Best Regional Hospital is a hospital that:<br/><ul><li>Offers a full range of general medical and surgical services (as opposed to a specialty hospital).</li><li>Either was nationally ranked in one of the 11 data-driven Best Hospitals specialties (excluding rehabilitation) <i>or</i> had seven or more ratings of high performing in the Best Hospitals procedures and conditions. Note that for Best Regional Hospitals eligibility and scoring purposes, the TAVR and AVR cohorts were combined, and ovarian and uterine cancer surgeries were combined.</li><li>In addition to the eligibility criteria, a hospital must have had at least three more high-performing procedures/conditions than below-average procedures/conditions to be a Best Regional Hospital this year.</li></ul><ul></ul>Nationwide, 493 hospitals were identified as Best Regional Hospitals, compared with 531 last year. The Best Hospitals for Maternity was not included in the Best Regional Hospitals calculation.<br/><br/><h3><b>How was each Best Regional Hospital assigned its numerical ranking?</b></h3><br/>In a given region (state or major metro area), a hospital on the Best Hospitals Honor Roll outranked all other hospitals not on the Honor Roll, regardless of point totals. Other hospitals located in each region were ranked according to the number of points they earned: Hospitals earned two points for each of the 11 data-driven Best Hospitals specialties in which they were nationally ranked and one point for each of the 11 specialties (excluding rehabilitation) and 18 procedures and conditions in which they were rated high performing (AVR and TAVR are combined in this calculation, as are ovarian and uterine cancer surgery).<br/><br/>In addition, hospitals lost one point for each procedure or condition in which they were rated below average. In some circumstances, where a health system with multiple hospitals had consolidated a certain service at a regional center of excellence, we reassigned Best Regional Hospitals points for that service from the system's center of excellence to the system's flagship hospital.<br/><br/><h3><b>Can a specialty hospital, such as an orthopedic, cancer or children's hospital, be recognized as a Best Regional Hospital if it is nationally ranked or high performing?</b></h3><br/>No. The primary intent of the designation is to identify hospitals that perform well across a range of specialties, conditions and procedures. A specialty hospital's profile and its ratings and rankings pages show the area or areas of care in which it is ranked or high performing.<br/><br/><h3><b>In which metropolitan areas and states were hospitals ranked?</b></h3><br/>U.S. News generally used the U.S. Census Bureau list of Metropolitan Statistical Areas to define metro areas, but we departed from MSAs in cases where we used larger Combined Statistical Areas, or combined adjacent MSAs, to include nearby smaller cities with nationally ranked hospitals. For example, we used the Detroit CSA instead of the Detroit MSA; we combined the Durham-Chapel Hill and Raleigh-Cary MSAs to define the Raleigh-Durham metro area.<br/><br/>Some metropolitan areas, such as Cincinnati, Kansas City and New York, cross state lines. Washington, D.C. is included as a metro area but not a state.<br/><br/><h3><b>What about hospitals in smaller metro areas or outside metro areas?</b></h3><br/>U.S. News has grouped counties and county equivalents like parishes into approximately 200 regions that reflect geography, local custom and regional health care markets. High performers were recognized but not numerically ranked in regions that are not major metro areas.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why weren't children's hospitals ranked in metro areas?</b></h3><br/>Very few metro areas have more than one or two <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Children's Hospitals</a>. That makes decisions about where to go for expert pediatric care simpler than for adult care; ranking small numbers of children's hospitals within a metro area wouldn't offer meaningful assistance. A Best Children's Hospitals <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/faq-how-and-why-we-rank-and-rate-hospitals#child-hospitals"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">FAQ</a> is available below.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""bestmaternity"">2022-2023 Best Hospitals for Maternity, Published December 2022 </label></h2><br/>Relatively little information is readily available to the public about which facilities across the country are best at caring for expectant parents following an uncomplicated pregnancy. By evaluating hospitals using core maternity and perinatal care data, including data primarily self-reported by hospitals, and by publishing this information publicly on each hospital’s usnews.com page, we aim to enhance the transparency of the maternity services provided for uncomplicated pregnancies. How U.S. News evaluated hospitals is addressed in this FAQ and a comprehensive methodology report is available as a <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/best_hospitals_for_maternity_final_methodology_2022"">downloadable PDF</a>.<br/><br/>The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity"">Best Hospitals for Maternity</a> differs from other procedures and conditions in a few important ways:<br/><ul><li>Due to the lower age of the patients seeking maternity care, much of the data used in the methodology were collected directly from hospitals rather than from Medicare data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Due to this, only hospitals deemed high performing were recognized. Other hospitals that participated in the survey have a scorecard describing their performance on individual metrics but no recognition is displayed.</li><li>Alongside the quality assessment are factors many new parents look for when choosing where to have a baby.</li></ul><h3>How did U.S. News evaluate hospitals in Maternity Care?</h3><br/>Following U.S. News’ Best Hospitals rankings and the procedure and condition ratings, <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/hospital-ratings/maternity"">Best Hospitals for Maternity</a> draws the quality of care from three categories: outcomes, process, and structure.<br/><ul><li>Outcomes: 60%.<br/><ul><li>C-section rates: 30%.</li><li>Newborn complications rates: 25%.</li><li>Episiotomy rates: 5%.</li></ul></li><li>Process: 35%.<br/><ul><li>Early elective delivery rates: 5%.</li><li>Exclusive breast milk feeding rates: 20%.</li><li>Vaginal birth after cesarean rates: 5%.</li><li>Transparency on racial/ethnic disparities: 5%.</li></ul></li><li>Structure: 5%.<br/><ul><li>Birthing-friendly practice: 5%.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>What data sources were used?</b></h3><br/>In the spring of 2022, U.S. News &amp; World Report invited hospitals that offer maternity care to self-report their maternity data to U.S. News via an online survey, the Maternity Services Survey, hosted on the <a  href=""https://hospitaldashboard.usnews.com"">U.S. News Hospital Dashboard</a>.<br/><br/>Primary data collection from hospitals was necessary because quality data available from other sources, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, were insufficient on their own to evaluate the quality of maternal and neonatal care. Data collection took place over two months and began on March 9, 2022.<br/><br/><h2><label  data-id=""children-hospital"">2022-2023 Best Children's Hospitals,<b> Published June 2022</b></label></h2>What is the purpose of the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings"">Best Children's Hospitals</a> rankings? When should they be consulted? How are they determined? The following FAQ addresses these and other Best Children's Hospitals questions. A fully detailed methodology report is available as a <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BCH_Methodology_2022-23.pdf"" target=""_blank"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:true,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/media/best-hospitals/BCH_Methodology_2022-23.pdf&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">downloadable PDF</a>.<br/><br/>For the 2022-2023 rankings, U.S. News requested medical data and other information from nearly 200 facilities. Of those, 119 turned in enough data to be evaluated in at least one specialty, and 90 were ranked in one or more.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why does U.S. News rank children's hospitals?</b></h3><br/>Relatively few children, compared with the number of adults, face life-threatening or rare conditions or have to go through complicated operations. A typical hospital, where nearly all inpatients are adults, simply cannot provide the caliber of expertise needed by a severely ill child. Even a hospital with a busy maternity unit may not be equipped to deal with a newborn who weighs just a few pounds or requires surgery for a congenital heart defect. Similarly, most hospitals don't see large numbers of children with cancer, respiratory illnesses or kidney conditions.<br/><br/>Even among children's hospitals and large pediatric services that do, the reality – as true in pediatrics as in adult care – is that some hospitals are better than others. That's why in 2006, U.S. News began collecting data that would allow ranking of pediatric centers on their ability to help children who need it the most.<br/><br/><h3><b>How are the rankings organized and updated?</b></h3>The 50 best-performing hospitals are ranked in each of 10 pediatric specialties. Unranked hospitals that provided enough information to be scored in a specialty are listed with their data but without rank or score. The rankings are updated annually in June. The <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-childrens-hospitals/articles/best-childrens-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll</a> recognizes the 10 hospitals that received the highest number of points, based on the number of specialties in which they are ranked and how high they ranked in each.<br/><br/><h3><b>What are the 10 specialties?</b></h3><ul><li>Cancer.</li><li>Cardiology and heart surgery.</li><li>Diabetes and endocrinology.</li><li>Gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery.</li><li>Neonatology.</li><li>Nephrology.</li><li>Neurology and neurosurgery.</li><li>Orthopedics.</li><li>Pulmonology and lung surgery.</li><li>Urology.</li></ul><h3><b>So the rankings should just be a starting point?</b></h3><br/>Exactly. Families have to weigh many considerations when they seek care for a child, including the stress and expense of traveling to another city with a sick child and staying for days or possibly weeks, as well as an insurer's willingness to pay for care at a hospital outside its approved network.<br/><br/>Within a specialty, hospital performance is judged across a variety of conditions and procedures. So one hospital might outperform another in some of them, the second might do better in others. In the<a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/orthopedics"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/orthopedics&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}""> pediatric orthopedic rankings</a>, for example, one hospital might have an especially busy spina bifida clinic but doesn't treat complex fractures as efficiently as another hospital. Parents and caregivers must decide for themselves which factors they want to weigh more or less heavily. Kids and families are all different. There's no one-size-fits-all.<br/><br/><h3><b>How is each hospital evaluated?</b></h3><br/>A third of each hospital's score, or 33.3%, was tied to outcomes such as survival, infections and surgical complications. (In cardiology &amp; heart surgery, outcomes counted for 38.3% because more and better data are available.) A hospital's reputation, based on an annual survey of pediatric specialists and subspecialists in each of the 10 specialties, made up another 13% (8% in cardiology &amp; heart surgery).<br/><br/>The remaining portion of slightly more than 50% evaluated commitment to patient safety (such as the number of specific ways infections are minimized), excellence (such as the number of fellowship programs) and family centeredness (such as the degree to which families are involved in their children's care).<br/><h3></h3><h3><b>Why does U.S. News include hospital reputation?</b></h3><br/>Experts' opinions can reflect important information that isn't evident in objective measurements. That's especially true in a field as full of nuance and complexity like the medical care of very sick children. We feel the opinions of pediatric specialists add to the objective measures that form the basis for the rankings.<br/><br/><h3><b>How are the rankings organized?</b></h3><br/>In each of the 10 specialty areas, the 50 hospitals with the highest scores are ranked numerically based on their overall score. Keep in mind that a lower-ranked hospital may be better in certain specialties than a hospital with a higher overall ranking in that specialty – and, importantly, hospitals with different rankings may be effectively equivalent on the attributes that matter most to a particular family.<br/><br/>You can learn about the nuanced differences by comparing hospitals' detailed scorecards, which show many of the measures that went into hospital scores. Some measures, such as nurse-to-patient ratios, are common to all specialties. Others, like accreditation for bone marrow transplant, apply to just one or two specialties.<br/><br/>In addition to displaying performance information for the 50 ranked hospitals in each specialty, the same information is shown for unranked hospitals if they provided enough data through the clinical survey to be evaluated. The unranked hospitals are listed alphabetically.<br/><br/><h3><b>What are the regional Best Children's Hospital rankings?</b></h3><br/>Each hospital that's ranked in at least one pediatric specialty, with two uncommon exclusions described here, is also assigned a ranking in its state and the multi-state region (there are seven) to which the state belongs. These <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatrics-area"">regional rankings</a> are intended to help families identify excellent pediatric centers near home.<br/><br/>Exclusions: Specialty pediatric hospitals, such as those that exclusively treat cancer, are excluded from the regional rankings. Additionally, a hospital that reports data for a specialty jointly with another hospital does not receive credit from that specialty toward a regional ranking unless the hospital is deemed by U.S. News to be the lead or co-lead hospital in that multi-hospital reporting relationship. Non-lead hospitals may be regionally ranked only if they are ranked on their own in another specialty or are the lead hospital in a joint reporting relationship in another specialty.<br/><br/>A map accompanying <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/coming-this-year-to-best-childrens-hospitals-regional-rankings"">this article</a> shows the seven multi-state regions and which states each region comprises.<br/><br/><h3><b>What is the significance of the </b><a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/best-childrens-hospitals/articles/best-childrens-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview"" style=""text-decoration:none;""><b>Honor Roll</b></a><b>?</b></h3><br/>The Best Children's Hospitals Honor Roll recognizes 10 hospitals that are unusually competent in many specialties.<br/><br/><h3><b>How is the Honor Roll determined?</b></h3><br/>Hospitals received points for being ranked in a specialty, and the 10 hospitals with the most points across the 10 specialties make up the Honor Roll. The first-ranked hospital in a specialty received 25 points, the second-ranked hospital received 24 points and so on, until reaching No. 21. All hospitals ranked 21 through 50 received five points. The Honor Roll would have been extended if multiple hospitals had tied for the tenth-most points overall.<br/><br/><h3><b>How did U.S. News choose which children's hospitals to evaluate?</b></h3><br/>Selection was determined initially by membership in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, or NACHRI, now called the Children's Hospital Association, or by nomination from teams of expert advisers. A hospital also can request to be considered. U.S. News makes such decisions not only on a hospital's willingness to engage in public reporting but also on the size and scope of its pediatric program.<br/><br/>Of approximately 200 hospitals U.S. News invites to participate in the survey each year, about a quarter of the hospitals are freestanding pediatric-focused facilities. Most of the others are pediatric departments within larger full-service hospitals and are so large that the department functions almost like its own hospital within a hospital – with its own staff, operating rooms and support services.<br/><br/><h3><b>Are there changes from last year?</b></h3><br/>Year to year, there are always changes – we constantly try to improve our methodology, using feedback we get from knowledgeable parents, doctors and health care leaders. Our approach is conservative, however, since any alterations in our analysis affect not only the new rankings but the ability to compare them with previous results. Some of this year's changes were highlighted in a <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-05-24/best-childrens-hospitals-2022-23-what-to-expect"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/second-opinion/articles/2022-05-24/best-childrens-hospitals-2022-23-what-to-expect&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">U.S. News blog post</a> published shortly before the rankings were released.<br/><br/><h3><b>How does U.S. News decide what changes to make to the methodology?</b></h3><br/>RTI International, a large North Carolina-based research and consulting firm that created the Best Children's Hospitals methodology in 2006 (and the U.S. News contractor for the <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Best Hospitals</a> rankings), works with experts organized into specialized working groups to review and update the methodology each year. U.S. News editors review proposed changes and approve them before they take effect.<br/><h3></h3><h3><b>Why does U.S. News ask hospitals for data instead of using existing data sources?</b></h3><br/>We use existing data whenever we can. The lack of critical data that can be tapped to evaluate children's hospitals has been a huge challenge. There is no pediatric equivalent of the Medicare database U.S. News mines to measure hospital performance in the annual Best Hospitals adult rankings and ratings.<br/><br/>In 2006, when U.S. News began looking into the possibility of ranking pediatric centers, children's hospitals had barely begun to develop standards for care-related quality data or how to best analyze the results. That is still largely the case, despite the meaningful progress pediatric researchers have made in certain areas of performance measurement.<br/><br/>So in 2006, U.S. News asked RTI to put together a clinical survey for children's hospitals. Some questions, such as nursing data and the extent and success of programs that prevent infection, touch on all 10 specialties. Others, such as complication rates of kidney biopsies and five-year survival rates for several types of cancer, are specialty-specific.<br/><br/><h3><b>What defines the three categories of quality measures – outcomes, process and structure – used in the rankings?</b></h3><br/><b>Outcomes</b><br/>These data reflect a hospital's ability to keep children alive, keep them safe from harm by protecting them from infections and surgical complications and improve the quality of life of children with chronic conditions. For example, we evaluate survival from three types of childhood cancers, bloodstream infections caused by central line catheters and success in managing severe asthma cases.<br/><br/><b>Process</b><br/>The intent of the U.S. News process measure is to evaluate how well and efficiently a hospital goes about the day-to-day business of delivering care. That is determined in part by compliance with widely endorsed ""best practices,"" such as regular morbidity and mortality conferences to explore unanticipated deaths or complications, and commitment to infection control, such as having certified infection preventionists on staff and tracking the correct use of antibiotics prior to surgery. Additionally, hospitals' efforts to advance equity, diversity and inclusion of patients and staff factor into the rankings.<br/><br/>It's important to have such programs, but they must deliver. So 13% of a hospital's score (8% in the cardiology &amp; heart surgery rankings) relies on the opinions of pediatric specialists and subspecialists via an annual survey that asks them to name up to 10 hospitals in their specialty where they would send the sickest patients without taking location or expense into account. Responses are combined from the three latest surveys, meaning for the 2022-2023 rankings, surveys conducted in 2020, 2021 and 2022. More than 24,000 physicians were surveyed in 2022, and more than 5,000 responded.<br/><br/><b>Structure</b><br/>This category reflects resources a hospital makes available to patients, like the number of nurses caring for patients. We collect information about 40 elements, many relevant to every specialty and others specific to just one. A few examples are the availability of surgery for <a  href=""https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-for-children-with-severe-congenital-heart-disease"" link-data=""{&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;newWindow&quot;:false,&quot;relations&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-for-children-with-severe-congenital-heart-disease&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;d82f1fd9-c1d7-315a-9519-34a46b1f526f&quot;},&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;809caec9-30e2-3666-8b71-b32ddbffc288&quot;}"">congenital heart defects</a> or for liver transplants, specialized clinics for children with diabetes or kidney disease and services for families that ease the anxiety of a child's hospital stay.<br/><br/><b>For PR-related questions, please contact health-pr@usnews.com.</b>","hospitals, patient advice, patients","faqhospitalranking, Best Children's Hospitals, Best Children’s Launch 2020-21, hospital FAQ, America's Best Hospitals, hospital overview, BH 2021 launch, BH 2022 launch",Wed Jun 21 00:01:17 EDT 2023,U.S. News Staff
